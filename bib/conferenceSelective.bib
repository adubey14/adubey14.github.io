  abstract = {The complexity of software in systems like aerospace vehicles has
	reached the point where new techniques are needed to ensure system
	dependability while improving the productivity of developers. 
	
	One possible approach is to use precisely defined software execution
	platforms that (1) enable the system to be composed from separate
	components, (2) restrict component interactions and prevent fault
	propagation, and (3) whose compositional properties are well-known.
	
	In this paper we describe the initial steps towards building a platform
	that combines component-based software construction with hard real-time
	operating system services. Specifically, the paper discusses how
	the CORBA Component Model (CCM) could be combined with the ARINC-653
	platform services and the lessons learned from this experiment. The
	results point towards both extending the CCM as well as revising
	the ARINC-653.},

	abstract = {Fractionated spacecraft - a cluster of simple satellites that are
wirelessly connected, perform high-resolution sensing functions by
running distributed sensor fusion applications. Coordinated swarms of
networked Unmanned Aerial Vehicles carry out data collection damage
assessment flights over large geographical areas affected by weather
events. Fleets of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles collect climate change
data from oceans with the help of sensor fusion and motion control
applications. Smart data acquisition and control devices implement
distributed sensing and control functions for the Smart Electric Grid.

Such {\textquoteleft}cyber-physical cloud computing platforms{\textquoteright} present novel
challenges because the system is built from mobile embedded devices,
is inherently distributed and typically has highly fluctuating
connectivity among the modules.  Architecting software for these
systems raises many challenges not present in traditional cloud
computing. Effective management of constrained resources and
application isolation without adversely affecting performance are
necessary.  Autonomous fault management and real-time performance
requirements must be met in a verifiable manner.  It is also both
critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose diverse
software applications have changing demands for computational and
communication resources, while operating on different levels and in
separate domains of security.

The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered
architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware
layer, and component-structured applications. The component model
facilitates the creation of software applications from modular and
reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and
interact only through well-defined mechanisms. The complexity of
creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated
through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process
that relies on a domain-specific modeling language and its
accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for
synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based
analysis for verification and validation.},

	sensor programs, which are executed periodically to facilitate performance
	and fault management. By construction, these clusters use general
	purpose operating systems such as Linux that are built for best average
	case performance and do not provide deterministic scheduling guarantees.
	Consequently, periodic applications show jitter in execution times
	relative to the expected execution time. Obtaining a deterministic
	schedule for periodic tasks in general purpose operating systems
	is difficult without using kernel-level modifications such as RTAI
	and RTLinux. However, due to performance and administrative issues
	kernel modification cannot be used in all scenarios. In this paper,
	we address the problem of jitter compensation for periodic tasks
	that cannot rely on modifying the operating system kernel. Towards
	that, (a) we present motivating examples; (b) we present a feedback
	controller based approach that runs in the user space and actively
	compensates periodic schedule based on past jitter; This approach
	is platform-agnostic i.e. it can be used in different operating systems
	without modification; and (c) we show through analysis and experiments
	that this approach is platform-agnostic i.e. it can be used in different
	operating systems without modification and also that it maintains
	a stable system with bounded total jitter.},
