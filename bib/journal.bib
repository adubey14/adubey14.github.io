  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a computation platform called ReachLab,
	which enables automatic analysis of embedded software systems that
	interact with continuous environment. Algorithms are used to specify
	how the state space of the system model should be explored in order
	to perform analysis. In ReachLab, both system models and analysis
	algorithm models are specified in the same framework using Hybrid
	System Analysis and Design Language (HADL), which is a meta-model
	based language. The platform allows the models of algorithms to be
	constructed hierarchically and promotes their reuse in constructing
	more complex algorithms. Moreover, the platform is designed in such
	a way that the concerns of design and implementation of analysis
	algorithms are separated. On one hand, the models of analysis algorithms
	are abstract and therefore the design of algorithms can be made independent
	of implementation details. On the other hand, translators are provided
	to automatically generate implementations from the models for computing
	analysis results based on computation kernels. Multiple computation
	kernels, which are based on specific computation tools such as d/dt
	and the Level Set toolbox, are supported and can be chosen to enable
	hybrid state space exploration. An example is provided to illustrate
	the design and implementation process in ReachLab.},
