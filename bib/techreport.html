 Towards model-based software health management for real-time systems.
 2010.
[&nbsp;<a href="resumetechreport_bib.html#4196">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
The complexity of software systems has reached the point where we need run-time mechanisms that
can be used to provide fault management services. Testing and verification may not cover all possible
scenarios that a system can encounter, hence a simpler, yet formally specified run-time monitoring,
diagnosis, and fault mitigation architecture is needed to increase the software systems dependability.
The approach described in this paper borrows concepts and principles from the field of Systems Health
Management for complex systems. The paper introduces the fundamental ideas for software health
management, and then illustrates how these can be implemented in a model-based software development process, including a case study and related work.

 A case study on the application of software health management
  techniques.
 (ISIS-11-101), 01/2011 2011.
[&nbsp;<a href="resumetechreport_bib.html#4245">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
Ever increasing complexity of software used in large-scale, safety critical cyber-physical systems makes it increasingly difficult to expose and thence correct all potential bugs. There is a need to augment the existing fault tolerance methodologies with new approaches that address latent software bugs exposed at runtime. This paper describes an approach that borrows and adapts traditional Systems Health Management techniques to improve software dependability through simple formal specification of  runtime monitoring, diagnosis  and mitigation strategies. The two-level approach of Health Management at Component and System level  is demonstrated on a simulated case study of an Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU).  That subsystem was categorized as the primary failure source for the in-flight upset caused in the Malaysian Air flight 124 over Perth, Australia in August 2005.

 Formalization of a component model for real-time systems.
 04/2012 2012.
[&nbsp;<a href="resumetechreport_bib.html#4507">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
Component-based software development for real-time systems necessitates a well-defined component model that allows compositional analysis and reasoning about systems. Such a model defines what a component is, how it works, and how it interacts with other components. It is especially important for real-time systems to have such a component model, as many problems in these systems arise from poorly understood and analyzed component interactions. In this paper we describe a component model for hard real-time systems that relies on the services of an ARINC-653 compliant real-time operating system platform. The model provides high-level abstractions of component interactions, both for the synchronous and asynchronous case. We present a formalization of the component model in the form of timed transition traces. Such formalization is necessary to be able  to derive interesting system level properties such as fault propagation graphs from models of component assemblies. We provide a brief discussion about such system level fault propagation templates  for this component model.
