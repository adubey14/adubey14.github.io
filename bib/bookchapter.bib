  abstract = {System-level detection, diagnosis, and mitigation of faults in complex
	systems that include physical components as well as software are
	essential to achieve high dependability. The paper introduces a model,
	referred to as the Timed Failure Propagation Graph (TFPG) that captures
	the causal propagation of observable fault effects in systems. Several
	algorithms based on this model have been developed, including: consistency-based
	centralized and distributed algorithms for multiple-fault fault source
	isolation in real-time, algorithms to calculate diagnosability metrics,
	and algorithms to prognosticate impending failures. The model and
	the associated algorithms are applicable to physical systems but
	recently they have been applied to component-based software systems
	as well, where similar fault propagation can take place. The paper
	describes the modeling paradigm, the algorithms developed, and how
	they were applied in a system and software context.},
