 abstract = {Software architecture description languages offer a convenient way of describing the high-level structure of a software system. Such descriptions facilitate rapid prototyping, code generation and automated analysis. One of the big challenges facing the software community is the design of architecture description languages that are general enough to describe a wide-range of systems, yet detailed enough to capture domain-specific properties and provide a high level of tool automation. This paper presents the multi-paradigm challenges we faced and solutions we built when creating a domain-specific modeling language for software architectures of distributed real-time systems.},
