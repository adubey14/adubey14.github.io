 abstract = {Residents in cities typically use third-party platforms such as Google Maps for route planning services. While providing near real-time processing, these state of the art centralized deployments are limited to multiprocessing environments in data centers. This raises privacy concerns, increases risk for critical data and causes vulnerability to network failure. In this paper, we propose to use decentralized road side units (RSU) (owned by the city) to perform route planning. We divide the city road network into grids, each assigned an RSU where traffic data is kept locally, increasing security and resiliency such that the system can perform even if some RSUs fail. Route generation is done in two steps. First, an optimal grid sequence is generated, prioritizing shortest path calculation accuracy but not RSU load. Second, we assign route planning tasks to the grids in the sequence. Keeping in mind RSU load and constraints, tasks can be allocated and executed in any non-optimal grid but with lower accuracy. We evaluate this system using Metropolitan Nashville road traffic data. We divided the area into 500 grids, configuring load and neighborhood sizes to meet delay constraints while maximizing model accuracy. The results show that there is a 30 percent decrease in processing time with a decrease in model accuracy of 99 percent to 92.3 percent, by simply increasing the search area to the optimal grid\textquoterights immediate neighborhood.},
