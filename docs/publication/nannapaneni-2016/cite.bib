 abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems with a tight integration between the computational (also referred to as software or cyber) and physical (hardware) components. While the reliability evaluation of physical systems is well-understood and well-studied, reliability evaluation of CPS is difficult because software systems do not degrade and follow a well-defined failure model like physical systems. In this paper, we propose a framework for formulating the CPS reliability evaluation as a dependence problem derived from the software component dependences, functional requirements and physical system dependences. We also consider sensor failures, and propose a method for estimating software failures in terms of associated hardware and software inputs. This framework is codified in a domain-specific modeling language, where every system-level function is mapped to a set of required components using functional decomposition and function-component association; this provides details about operational constraints and dependences. We also illustrate how the encoded information can be used to make reconfiguration decisions at runtime. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a smart parking system, which provides localization and guidance for parking within indoor environments.},
