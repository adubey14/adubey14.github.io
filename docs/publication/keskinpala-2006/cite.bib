 abstract = {This paper presents a contribution to the challenges of manually creating test configurations and deployments for high performance distributed middleware frameworks. We present our testing tool based on the Model Integrated Computing (MIC) paradigm and describe and discuss its generative abilities that can be used to generate many test configurations and deployment scenarios from high-level system specifications through model replication. },
