 abstract = {Recent advancements in cloud computing have
driven rapid development in data-intensive smart city applications
by providing near real time processing and storage
scalability. This has resulted in efficient centralized route planning
services such as Google Maps, upon which millions of
users rely. Route planning algorithms have progressed in line
with the cloud environments in which they run. Current state
of the art solutions assume a shared memory model, hence
deployment is limited to multiprocessing environments in data
centers. By centralizing these services, latency has become the
limiting parameter in the technologies of the future, such as
autonomous cars. Additionally, these services require access
to outside networks, raising availability concerns in disaster
scenarios. Therefore, this paper provides a decentralized route
planning approach for private fog networks. We leverage recent
advances in federated learning to collaboratively learn shared
prediction models online and investigate our approach with a
simulated case study from a mid-size U.S. city.},
