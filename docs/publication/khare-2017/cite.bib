 abstract = {Emerging smart services, such as indoor smart parking or patient monitoring and tracking in hospitals, incur a significant technical roadblock stemming primarily from a lack of cost-effective and easily deployable localization framework that impedes their widespread deployment. To address this concern, in this paper we present a low-cost, indoor localization and navigation system, which performs continuous and real-time processing of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and IEEE 802.15.4a compliant Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensor data to localize and navigate the concerned entity to its desired location. Our approach depends upon fusing the two feature sets, using the UWB to calibrate the BLE localization mechanism.},
