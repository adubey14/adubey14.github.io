 abstract = {The complexity of software in systems like aerospace vehicles has reached the point where new techniques are needed to ensure system dependability while improving the productivity of developers. One possible approach is to use precisely defined software execution platforms that (1) enable the system to be composed from separate components, (2) restrict component interactions and prevent fault propagation, and (3) whose compositional properties are well-known. In this paper we describe the initial steps towards building a platform that combines component-based software construction with hard real-time operating system services. Specifically, the paper discusses how the CORBA Component Model (CCM) could be combined with the ARINC-653 platform services and the lessons learned from this experiment. The results point towards both extending the CCM as well as revising the ARINC-653.},
