 abstract = {While traditional design-time and off-line approaches to testing and verification contribute significantly to improving and ensuring high dependability of software, they may not cover all possible fault scenarios that a system could encounter at runtime. Thus, runtime health management of complex embedded software systems is needed to improve their dependability. Our approach to Software Health Management uses concepts from the field of Systems Health Management: detection, diagnosis and mitigation. In earlier work we had shown how to use a reactive mitigation strategy specified using a timed state machine model for system health manager. This paper describes the algorithm and key concepts for an alternative approach to system mitigation using a deliberative strategy, which relies on a function-allocation model to identify alternative component-assembly configurations that can restore the functions needed for the goals of the system.},
