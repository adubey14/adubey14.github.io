 abstract = {With the advent of pervasive cloud computing technologies, service reliability and availability are becoming major concerns,especially as we start to integrate cyber-physical systems with the cloud networks. A number of smart and connected community systems such as emergency response systems utilize cloud networks to analyze real-time data streams and provide context-sensitive decision support.Improving overall system reliability requires us to study all the aspects of the end-to-end of this distributed system,including the backend data servers. In this paper, we describe a bi-layered prognostic architecture for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of components of backend servers,especially those that are subjected to degradation. We show that our architecture is especially good at predicting the remaining useful life of hard disks. A Deep LSTM Network is used as the backbone of this fast, data-driven decision framework and dynamically captures the pattern of the incoming data. In the article, we discuss the architecture of the neural network and describe the mechanisms to choose the various hyper-parameters. We describe the challenges faced in extracting effective training sets from highly unorganized and class-imbalanced big data and establish methods for online predictions with extensive data pre-processing, feature extraction and validation through test sets with unknown remaining useful lives of the hard disks. Our algorithm performs especially well in predicting RUL near the critical zone of a device approaching failure.The proposed architecture is able to predict whether a disk is going to fail in next ten days with an average precision of 0.8435.In future, we will extend this architecture to learn and predict the RUL of the edge devices in the end-to-end distributed systems of smart communities, taking into consideration context-sensitive external features such as weather.},
