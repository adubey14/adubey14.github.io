Due to the complexity of the problem, practical problem instances can be solved only via heuristics, which trade-off solution quality for computational tractability. Among the various heuristics, a common strategy is problem decomposition, that is, the reduction of a largescale problem into a collection of smaller sub-problems, with spatial and temporal decompositions being two natural approaches. While spatial decomposition has been successful in certain settings, effective temporal decomposition has been challenging due to the difficulty of stitching together the sub-problem solutions across the decomposition boundaries. In this work, we introduce a novel temporal decomposition scheme for solving a class of PDPTWs that have narrow time windows, for which it is able to provide both fast and highquality solutions. We utilize techniques that have been popularized recently in the context of online dial-a-ride problems along with the general idea of rolling horizon optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve offline PDPTWs using such an approach. To show the performance and scalability of our framework, we use the optimization of paratransit services as a motivating example. Due to the lack of benchmark solvers similar to ours (i.e., temporal decomposition with an online solver), we compare our results with an offline heuristic algorithm using Google OR-Tools. In smaller problem instances (with an average of 129 requests per instance), the baseline approach is as competitive as our framework. However, in larger problem instances (approximately 2,500 requests per instance), our framework is more scalable and can provide good solutions to problem instances of varying degrees of difficulty, while the baseline algorithm often fails to find a feasible solution within comparable compute times.","tags":["Cyber physical Systems","Public Transportation","Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"Rolling Horizon based Temporal Decomposition for the Offline Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose Paolo Talusan","Ayan Mukhopadhyay","Dan Freudberg","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130347,"objectID":"1664380274c2d23902380ea0b44f967e","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/talusan-2022-apc/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:07.162669Z","relpermalink":"/publication/talusan-2022-apc/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to accurately predict public transit ridership demand benefits passengers and transit agencies. Agencies will be able to reallocate buses to handle under or over-utilized bus routes, improving resource utilization, and passengers will be able to adjust and plan their schedules to avoid overcrowded buses and maintain a certain level of comfort. However, accurately predicting occupancy is a non-trivial task. Various reasons such as heterogeneity, evolving ridership patterns, exogenous events like weather, and other stochastic variables, make the task much more challenging. With the progress of big data, transit authorities now have access to real-time passenger occupancy information for their vehicles. The amount of data generated is staggering. While there is no shortage in data, it must still be cleaned, processed, augmented, and merged before any useful information can be generated. In this paper, we propose the use and fusion of data from multiple sources, cleaned, processed, and merged together, for use in training machine learning models to predict transit ridership. We use data that spans a 2-year period (2020-2022) incorporating transit, weather, traffic, and calendar data. The resulting data, which equates to 17 million observations, is used to train separate models for the trip and stop level prediction. We evaluate our approach on real-world transit data provided by the public transit agency of Nashville, TN. We demonstrate that the trip level model based on Xgboost and the stop level model based on LSTM outperform the baseline statistical model across the entire transit service day.","tags":[""],"title":"On Designing Day Ahead and Same Day Ridership Level Prediction Models for City-Scale Transit Networks Using Noisy APC Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geoffrey Pettet","Ayan Mukhopadhyay","Mykel J.

Consider emergency response, where urban planners and first responders optimize the location of ambulances to minimize expected response times to incidents such as road accidents. Typically, such problems involve sequential decision making under uncertainty and can be modeled as Markov (or semi-Markov) decision processes. The goal of the decision maker is to learn a mapping from states to actions that can maximize expected rewards. While online, offline, and decentralized approaches have been proposed to tackle such problems, scalability remains a challenge for real world use cases. We present a general approach to hierarchical planning that leverages structure in city level CPS problems for resource allocation. We use emergency response as a case study and show how a large resource allocation problem can be split into smaller problems. We then use Monte Carlo planning for solving the smaller problems and managing the interaction between them. Finally, we use data from Nashville, Tennessee, a major metropolitan area in the United States, to validate our approach.

At the same time, there are underutilized computing resources within cities and local edge-computing deployments. Using these slack resources may enable significantly lower pricing than comparable cloud computing; such resources would incur minimal marginal expenditure since their deployment and operation are mostly sunk costs. However, there are challenges associated with using these resources. First, they are not effectively aggregated or provisioned. Second, there is a lack of trust between customers and suppliers of computing resources, given that they are distinct stakeholders and behave according to their own interests. Third, delays in processing inputs may diminish the value of the applications. To resolve these challenges, we introduce an architecture combining a distributed trusted computing mechanism, such as a blockchain, with an efficient messaging system like Apache Pulsar. Using this architecture, we design a decentralized computation market where customers and suppliers make offers to deploy and host applications. The proposed architecture can be realized using any trusted computing mechanism that supports smart contracts, and any messaging framework with the necessary features. This combination ensures that the market is robust without incurring the input processing delays that limit other blockchain based solutions. We evaluate the market protocol using game-theoretic analysis to show that deviation from the protocol is discouraged. Finally, we assess the performance of a prototype implementation based on experiments with a streaming computer-vision application.","tags":[],"title":"Decentralized Computation Market for Stream Processing Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vineet Nair","Kritika Prakash","Michael Wilbur","Aparna Taneja","Corinne Namblard","Oyindamola Adeyemo","Abhishek Dubey","Abiodun Adereni","Milind Tambe","Ayan Mukhopadhyay"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130348,"objectID":"4e2c9c653885faf38f2aaf888680477f","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/ijcai-22-ayan/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:08.136535Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijcai-22-ayan/","section":"publication","summary":"More than 5 million children under five years die from largely preventable or treatable medical conditions every year, with an overwhelmingly large proportion of deaths occurring in under-developed countries with low vaccination uptake.

Based on discussions with public transit agencies, we identify a real-world problem that is not addressed by existing formulations: booking trips with flexible pickup windows (e.g., 3 hours) in advance (e.g., the day before) and confirming tight pickup windows (e.g., 30 minutes) at the time of booking. Such a service model is often required in paratransit service settings, where passengers typically book trips for the next day over the phone. To address this gap between offline and online problems, we introduce a novel formulation, the offline vehicle routing problem with online bookings. This problem is very challenging computationally since it faces the complexity of considering large sets of requests—similar to offline VRPs—but must abide by strict constraints on running time—similar to online VRPs. To solve this problem, we propose a novel computational approach, which combines an anytime algorithm with a learning-based policy for real-time decisions.

The spread of the coronavirus disease has further elevated the importance of ridership prediction as crowded vehicles now present not only an inconvenience but also a public-health risk. At the same time, accurately predicting ridership has become more challenging due to evolving ridership patterns, which may make all data except for the most recent records stale. One promising approach for improving prediction accuracy is to fine-tune the hyper-parameters of machine-learning models for each transit route based on the characteristics of the particular route, such as the number of records. However, manually designing a machine-learning model for each route is a labor-intensive process, which may require experts to spend a significant amount of their valuable time. To help experts with designing machine-learning models, we propose a neural-architecture and feature search approach, which optimizes the architecture and features of a deep neural network for predicting the ridership of a public-transit route. Our approach is based on a randomized local hyper-parameter search, which minimizes both prediction error as well as the complexity of the model. We evaluate our approach on real-world ridership data provided by the public transit agency of Chattanooga, TN, and we demonstrate that training neural networks whose architectures and features are optimized for each route provides significantly better performance than training neural networks whose architectures and features are generic.","tags":[""],"title":"Neural Architecture and Feature Search for Predicting the Ridership of Public Transportation Routes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

To avoid decisions that lead to significant inefficiency in the long term, vehicles should be allocated to requests by optimizing a non-myopic utility function or by batching requests together and optimizing a myopic utility function. While the former approach is typically offline, the latter can be performed online. We point out two major issues with such approaches when applied to paratransit services in practice. First, it is difficult to batch paratransit requests together as they are temporally sparse. Second, the environment in which transit agencies operate changes dynamically (e.g., traffic conditions can change over time), causing the estimates that are learned offline to become stale. To address these challenges, we propose a fully online approach to solve the dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with time windows and stochastic trip requests that is robust to changing environmental dynamics by construction. We focus on scenarios where requests are relatively sparse---our problem is motivated by applications to paratransit services. We formulate DVRP as a Markov decision process and use Monte Carlo tree search to compute near-optimal actions for any given state. Accounting for stochastic requests while optimizing a non-myopic utility function is computationally challenging; indeed, the action space for such a problem is intractably large in practice. To tackle the large action space, we leverage the structure of the problem to design heuristics that can sample promising actions for the tree search. Our experiments using real-world data from our partner agency show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both in terms of performance and robustness.","tags":[],"title":"An Online Approach to Solve the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Trip Requests for Paratransit Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaminur Islam","Jose Paolo Talusan","Shameek Bhattacharjee","Francis Tiausas","Sayyed Mohsen Vazirizade","Abhishek Dubey","Keiichi Yasumoto","Sajal Das"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130349,"objectID":"a0cb0593471d76709214e1b33e98a318","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/jp-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:09.29962Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jp-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern smart cities are focusing on smart transportation solutions to detect and mitigate the effects of various traffic incidents in the city.

Specifically, we propose an incremental region growing approximation algorithm for optimal Spatio-temporal clustering of road segments and their data; such that road segments are strategically divided into highly correlated clusters. The highly correlated clusters enable identifying a Pythagorean Mean-based invariant as an anomaly detection metric that is highly stable under no incidents but shows a deviation in the presence of incidents. We learn the bounds of the invariants in a robust manner such that anomaly detection can generalize to unseen events, even when learning from real noisy data.

However, the problem is that the sampled observations used for training the model may never cover the entire state space of the physical environment, and as a result, the system will likely operate in conditions that do not belong to the training distribution. These conditions that do not belong to training distribution are referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD). Detecting OOD conditions at runtime is critical for the safety of CPS. In addition, it is also desirable to identify the context or the feature(s) that are the source of OOD to select an appropriate control action to mitigate the consequences that may arise because of the OOD condition. In this article, we study this problem as a multi-labeled time series OOD detection problem over images, where the OOD is defined both sequentially across short time windows (change points) as well as across the training data distribution. A common approach to solving this problem is the use of multi-chained one-class classifiers. However, this approach is expensive for CPSs that have limited computational resources and require short inference times. Our contribution is an approach to design and train a single β-Variational Autoencoder detector with a partially disentangled latent space sensitive to variations in image features. We use the feature sensitive latent variables in the latent space to detect OOD images and identify the most likely feature(s) responsible for the OOD. We demonstrate our approach using an Autonomous Vehicle in the CARLA simulator and a real-world automotive dataset called nuImages.","tags":[""],"title":"Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Latent Space of β-VAE for Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shreyas Ramakrishna","Baiting Luo","Yogesh Barve","Gabor Karsai","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130364,"objectID":"76a4fde32e6ffd0ffb98ab94f030ec65","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/icaa-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:24.032074Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icaa-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems must often operate under uncertainties like sensor degradation and distribution shifts in the operating environment, thus increasing operational risk. Dynamic Assurance of these systems requires augmenting runtime safety components like out-of-distribution detectors and risk estimators. Designing these safety components requires labeled data from failure conditions and risky corner cases that fail the system. However, collecting real-world data of these high-risk scenes can be expensive and sometimes not possible. To address this, there are several scenario description languages with sampling capability for generating synthetic data from simulators to replicate the scenes that are not possible in the real world. Most often, simple search-based techniques like random search and grid search are used as samplers. But we point out three limitations in using these techniques. First, they are passive samplers, which do not use the feedback of previous results in the sampling process. Second, the variables to be sampled may have constraints that need to be applied. Third, they do not balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, which we hypothesize is needed for better coverage of the search space. We present a scene generation workflow with two samplers called Random Neighborhood Search (RNS) and Guided Bayesian Optimization (GBO). These samplers extend the conventional random search and Bayesian Optimization search with the limitation points. We demonstrate our approach using an Autonomous Vehicle case study in CARLA simulation. To evaluate our samplers, we compared them against the baselines of random search, grid search, and Halton sequence search.","tags":[""],"title":"Risk-Aware Scene Sampling for Dynamic Assurance of Autonomous Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brendan McLoughlin","Sambridhi Bhandari","Erin Henrick","Erin Hotchkiss","Manoj Jha","Steven Jiang","Emily Kern","Landon Marston","Christopher Vanags","Caitlin Snyder"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130346,"objectID":"9e6c58a8257b283746807e5c141b1a94","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/mcloughlin-2022-modular/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:05.964179Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcloughlin-2022-modular/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["AI and CPS for Social Good"],"title":"A modular approach for integrating data science concepts into multiple undergraduate STEM+ C courses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayan Mukhopadhyay","Geoffrey Pettet","Sayyed Mohsen Vazirizade","Di Lu","Alejandro Jaimes","Said El Said","Hiba Baroud","Yevgeniy Vorobeychik","Mykel Kochenderfer","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130354,"objectID":"62875730139e369f3cf0a3dd5e701862","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/mukhopadhyay-2021-review/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:14.05617Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mukhopadhyay-2021-review/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last fifty years, researchers have developed statistical, data-driven, analytical, and algorithmic approaches for designing and improving emergency response management (ERM) systems.

Such systems need to be thoroughly tested and validated before being deployed in the real world to avoid such events. Testing in open-world scenarios can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. These challenges can be addressed by using driving simulators such as CARLA instead. A key part of such tests is adversarial testing, in which the goal is to find scenarios that lead to failures of the given system. While several independent efforts in adversarial testing have been made, a well-established testing framework that enables adaptive stress testing has yet to be made available for CARLA. We therefore propose ANTI-CARLA, an adversarial testing framework in CARLA. The operating conditions in which a given system should be tested are specified in a scenario description language. The framework offers an adversarial search mechanism that searches for operating conditions that will fail the tested system. In this way, ANTI-CARLA extends the CARLA simulator with the capability of performing adversarial testing on any given driving pipeline. We use ANTI-CARLA to test the driving pipeline trained with Learning By Cheating (LBC) approach. The simulation results demonstrate that ANTI-CARLA can effectively and automatically find a range of failure cases despite LBC reaching an accuracy of 100% in the CARLA benchmark.","tags":[],"title":"ANTI-CARLA: An Adversarial Testing Framework for Autonomous Vehicles in CARLA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shreyas Ramakrishna","Hyunjee Jin","Abhishek Dubey","Arun Ramamurthy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130349,"objectID":"c3d1177c44f43823fae1cd94ec9ac74c","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/ramakrishna-2022-assurance/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:09.105901Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ramakrishna-2022-assurance/","section":"publication","summary":"Assurance Cases are increasingly being required for regulatory acceptance of Cyber-Physical Systems. However, the ever-increasing complexity of these systems has made the assurance cases development complex, labor-intensive and time-consuming. Assurance case fragments called patterns are used to handle the complexity. The state-of-the-art approach has been to manually select generic patterns from online catalogs, instantiate them with system-specific information, and assemble them into an assurance case. While there has been some work in automating the instantiation and assembly, a less researched area is the automation of the pattern selection process, which takes a considerable amount of the assurance case development time. To close this automation gap, we have developed an automated pattern selection workflow that handles the selection problem as a coverage problem, intending to find the smallest set of patterns that can cover the available system artifacts. For this, we utilize the ontology graphs of the system artifacts and the patterns and perform graph analytics. The selected patterns are fed into an external instantiation function to develop an assurance case. Then, they are evaluated for coverage using two coverage metrics. An illustrative autonomous vehicle example is provided, demonstrating the utility of the proposed workflow in developing an assurance case with reduced efforts and time compared to the manual development alternative.","tags":[],"title":"Automating Pattern Selection for Assurance Case Development for Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rishav Sen","Toan Tran","Seyedmehdi Khaleghian","Mina Sartipi","Himanshu Neema","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130347,"objectID":"2bb04341884a9dbe95e1c341b7600774","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/sen-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:06.979179Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sen-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"The public commute is essential to all urban centers and is an efficient and environment-friendly way to travel. Transit systems must become more accessible and user-friendly. Since public transit is majorly designed statically, with very few improvements coming over time, it can get stagnated, unable to update itself with changing population trends. To better understand transportation demands and make them more usable, efficient, and demographic-focused, we propose a fast, multi-layered transit simulation that primarily focuses on public transit simulation (BTE-Sim). BTE-Sim is designed based on the population demand, existing traffic conditions, and the road networks that exist in a region. The system is versatile, with the ability to run different configurations of the existing transit routes, or inculcate any new changes that may seem necessary, or even in extreme cases, new transit network design as well. In all situations, it can compare multiple transit networks and provide evaluation metrics for them. It provides detailed data on each transit vehicle, the trips it performs, its on-time performance and other necessary factors. Its highlighting feature is the considerably low computation time it requires to perform all these tasks and provide consistently reliable results.","tags":[""],"title":"BTE-Sim: Fast simulation environment for public transportation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geoffrey Pettet","Ayan Mukhopadhyay","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130348,"objectID":"7dca4bdf7dc950ede6584dacc62f2996","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/pettet-2022-decision/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:08.732656Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pettet-2022-decision/","section":"publication","summary":"Decision-making under uncertainty (DMU) is present in many important problems. An open challenge is DMU in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics of the environment can change over time. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a popular approach for DMU problems, learns a policy by interacting with a model of the environment offline. Unfortunately, if the environment changes the policy can become stale and take sub-optimal actions, and relearning the policy for the updated environment takes time and computational effort. An alternative is online planning approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which perform their computation at decision time. Given the current environment, MCTS plans using high-fidelity models to determine promising action trajectories. These models can be updated as soon as environmental changes are detected to immediately incorporate them into decision making. However, MCTS's convergence can be slow for domains with large state-action spaces. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid decision-making approach that combines the strengths of RL and planning while mitigating their weaknesses. Our approach, called Policy Augmented MCTS (PA-MCTS), integrates a policy's actin-value estimates into MCTS, using the estimates to seed the action trajectories favored by the search. We hypothesize that PA-MCTS will converge more quickly than standard MCTS while making better decisions than the policy can make on its own when faced with nonstationary environments. We test our hypothesis by comparing PA-MCTS with pure MCTS and an RL agent applied to the classical CartPole environment. We find that PC-MCTS can achieve higher cumulative rewards than the policy in isolation under several environmental shifts while converging in significantly fewer iterations than pure MCTS.","tags":[],"title":"Decision Making in Non-Stationary Environments with Policy-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sophie Pavia","J.

Decision support under adverse dynamic events, specially if forecasted, can be supplemented by intelligent proactive control. Power system operation during wildfires require resiliency-driven proactive control for load shedding, line switching and resource allocation considering the dynamics of the wildfire and failure propagation. However, possible number of line- and load-switching in a large system during an event make traditional prediction-driven and stochastic approaches computationally intractable, leading operators to often use greedy algorithms. We model and solve the proactive control problem as a Markov decision process and introduce an integrated testbed for spatio-temporal wildfire propagation and proactive power-system operation. We transform the enormous wildfire-propagation observation space and utilize it as part of a heuristic for proactive de-energization of transmission assets. We integrate this heuristic with a reinforcement-learning based proactive policy for controlling the generating assets. Our approach allows this controller to provide setpoints for a part of the generation fleet, while a myopic operator can determine the setpoints for the remaining set, which results in a symbiotic action. We evaluate our approach utilizing the IEEE 24-node system mapped on a hypothetical terrain. Our results show that the proposed approach can help the operator to reduce load loss during an extreme event, reduce power flow through lines that are to be de-energized, and reduce the likelihood of infeasible power-flow solutions, which would indicate violation of short-term thermal limits of transmission lines.","tags":[""],"title":"Reinforcement Learning based Proactive Control for Transmission Grid Resilience to Wildfire","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhuangwei Kang","Ayan Mukhopadhyay","Aniruddha Gokhale","Shijie Wen","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130348,"objectID":"d267142ded330f6d3c8a6382d6e7f0d1","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/kang-2022-generative/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:07.949816Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kang-2022-generative/","section":"publication","summary":"Traffic congestion anomaly detection is of paramount importance in intelligent traffic systems.

However, these networks have been shown to make erroneous predictions to anomalous inputs, which manifests either due to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data or adversarial attacks. To detect these anomalies, a separate DNN called assurance monitor is often trained and used in parallel to the controller DNN, increasing the resource burden and latency. We hypothesize that a single network that can perform controller predictions and anomaly detection is necessary to reduce the resource requirements. Deep-Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks provide a rejection class alongside the class predictions, which can be utilized for detecting anomalies at runtime. However, the use of RBF activation functions limits the applicability of these networks to only classification tasks. In this paper, we show how the deep-RBF network can be used for detecting anomalies in CPS regression tasks such as continuous steering predictions. Further, we design deep-RBF networks using popular DNNs such as NVIDIA DAVE-II, and ResNet20, and then use the resulting rejection class for detecting adversarial attacks such as a physical attack and data poison attack. Finally, we evaluate these attacks and the trained deep-RBF networks using a hardware CPS testbed called DeepNNCar and a real-world German Traffic Sign Benchmark (GTSB) dataset. Our results show that the deep-RBF networks can robustly detect these attacks in a short time without additional resource requirements.","tags":[],"title":"Deep-RBF Networks for Anomaly Detection in Automotive Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Wilbur","Philip Pugliese","Aron Laszka","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130363,"objectID":"cc347462e1becad2af59fbcf0b3d2dc1","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/wilbur-21/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:23.345376Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wilbur-21/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern intelligent urban mobility applications are underpinned by large-scale, multivariate, spatiotemporal data streams.

However, because of the high upfront cost of these vehicles, most agencies are tasked with managing a mixed-fleet of internal combustion vehicles (ICEVs), EVs, and HVs. In managing mixed-fleets, agencies require accurate predictions of energy use for optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, and ensuring that emission standards are met. The current state-of-the-art is to develop separate neural network models to predict energy consumption for each vehicle class. Although different vehicle classes' energy consumption depends on a varied set of covariates, we hypothesize that there are broader generalizable patterns that govern energy consumption and emissions. In this paper, we seek to extract these patterns to aid learning to address two problems faced by transit agencies. First, in the case of a transit agency which operates many ICEVs, HVs, and EVs, we use multi-task learning (MTL) to improve accuracy of forecasting energy consumption. Second, in the case where there is a significant variation in vehicles in each category, we use inductive transfer learning (ITL) to improve predictive accuracy for vehicle class models with insufficient data. As this work is to be deployed by our partner agency, we also provide an online pipeline for joining the various sensor streams for  xed-line transit energy prediction. We find that our approach outperforms vehicle-specific baselines in both the MTL and ITL settings.","tags":[],"title":"Energy and Emission Prediction for Mixed-Vehicle Transit Fleets Using Multi-Task and Inductive Transfer Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geoffrey Pettet","Ayan Mukhopadhyay","Mykel Kochenderfer","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130364,"objectID":"d8057e38d5a91f438d34355488a0faed","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/iccps-2021/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:23.836912Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iccps-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"A classical problem in city-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS) is resource allocation under uncertainty.

While online, offline, and decentralized methodologies have been used to tackle such problems, none of the approaches scale well for large-scale decision problems. We create a general approach to hierarchical planning that leverages structure in city-level CPS problems to tackle resource allocation under uncertainty.

These statistical models are then used for proactive stationing which allocates first responders across the spatial area in order to reduce overall response time. Traditional methods that simply aggregate past incidents over space and time fail to make useful short-term predictions when the spatial region is large and focused on fine-grained spatial entities like interstate highway networks. This is partially due to the sparsity of incidents with respect to the area in consideration. Further, accidents are affected by several covariates, and collecting, cleaning, and managing multiple streams of data from various sources is challenging for large spatial areas. In this paper, we highlight how this problem is being solved for the state of Tennessee, a state in the USA with a total area of over 100,000 sq. km. Our pipeline, based on a combination of synthetic resampling, non-spatial clustering, and learning from data can efficiently forecast the spatial and temporal dynamics of accident occurrence, even under sparse conditions. In the paper, we describe our pipeline that uses data related to roadway geometry, weather, historical accidents, and real-time traffic congestion to aid accident forecasting. To understand how our forecasting model can affect allocation and dispatch, we improve upon a classical resource allocation approach.

Unfortunately, transit services that provide wide coverage tend to suffer from relatively low utilization, which results in high fuel usage per passenger per mile, leading to high operating costs and environmental impact. Electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy costs and environmental impact, but most public transit agencies have to employ them in combination with conventional, internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high upfront costs of EVs.  To make the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit agencies need to optimize route assignments and charging schedules, which presents a challenging problem for large transit networks.  We introduce a novel problem formulation to minimize fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit trips and scheduling them for charging, while serving an existing fixed-route transit schedule.  We present an integer program for optimal assignment and scheduling, and we propose polynomial-time heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms for larger networks. We evaluate our algorithms on the public transit service of Chattanooga, TN using operational data collected from transit vehicles.  Our results show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and can reduce energy use and, hence, environmental impact and operational costs.  For Chattanooga, the proposed algorithms can save $145,635 in energy costs and 576.7 metric tons of CO2 emission annually.","tags":[],"title":"Minimizing Energy Use of Mixed-Fleet Public Transit for Fixed-Route Service","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhuangwei Kang","Yogesh D.

Unfortunately, the traditional approach to receiving incident reports (e.g., calling 911 in the USA) has time delays. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze provide an opportunity for early identification of incidents. However, detecting incidents from crowdsourced data streams is difficult due to the challenges of noise and uncertainty associated with such data. Further, simply optimizing over detection accuracy can compromise spatial-temporal localization of the inference, thereby making such approaches infeasible for real-world deployment. This paper presents a novel problem formulation and solution approach for practitioner-centered incident detection using crowdsourced data by using emergency response management as a case-study. The proposed approach CROME (Crowdsourced Multi-objective Event Detection) quantifies the relationship between the performance metrics of incident classification (e.g., F1 score) and the requirements of model practitioners (e.g., 1 km. radius for incident detection). First, we show how crowdsourced reports, ground-truth historical data, and other relevant determinants such as traffic and weather can be used together in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for early detection of emergency incidents. Then, we use a Pareto optimization-based approach to optimize the output of the CNN in tandem with practitioner-centric parameters to balance detection accuracy and spatial-temporal localization. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this approach using crowdsourced data from Waze and traffic accident reports from Nashville, TN, USA.

We estimate rider-ship data using historical automated passenger counting data, conditional on a set of relevant determinants. Accurate ridership forecasting is essential to optimize the public transit schedule,  which is necessary to improve current fixed lines with on-demand transit. Also, passenger crowding has been a problem for public transportation since it deteriorates passengers' wellbeing and satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, passenger crowding has gained importance since it represents a  risk for social distancing violations.

This risk may arise due to distribution shifts, environmental context, or failure of software or hardware components. Traditional techniques for risk assessment focus on design-time techniques such as hazard analysis, risk reduction, and assurance cases among others. However, these static, design time techniques do not consider the dynamic contexts and failures the systems face at runtime. We hypothesize that this requires a dynamic assurance approach that computes the likelihood of unsafe conditions or system failures considering the safety requirements, assumptions made at design time, past failures in a given operating context, and the likelihood of system component failures. We introduce the ReSonAte dynamic risk estimation framework for autonomous systems. ReSonAte reasons over Bow-Tie Diagrams (BTDs), which capture information about hazard propagation paths and control strategies. Our innovation is the extension of the BTD formalism with attributes for modeling the conditional relationships with the state of the system and environment. We also describe a technique for estimating these conditional relationships and equations for estimating risk-based on the state of the system and environment. To help with this process, we provide a scenario modeling procedure that can use the prior distributions of the scenes and threat conditions to generate the data required for estimating the conditional relationships. To improve scalability and reduce the amount of data required, this process considers each control strategy in isolation and composes several single-variate distributions into one complete multi-variate distribution for the control strategy in question.

Most electronic systems such as hard disks routinely collect such reliability parameters in the field to monitor the health of the system. Changes in parameters as a function of time are monitored and any observed changes are compared with the known failure signatures. If the trajectory of the measured data matches that of a failure signature, operators are alerted to take corrective action. However, the interest of the operators lies in being able to identify the failures before they occur. The state of the art methodology including our prior work is to train machine learning models on temporal sequence data capturing the variations across multiple features and using it to predict the remaining useful life of the devices. However, as we show in this paper temporal prediction capability alone is not sufficient and can lead to low precision and the uncertainty around the prediction is very large. This is primarily due to the non-uniform progression of feature patterns over time. Our hypothesis is that the accuracy can be improved if we combine the temporal prediction methods with a spatial analysis that compares the value of key SMART features of the devices across similar model in a fixed time window (unlike the temporal method which uses the data from a single device and a much larger historical window). In this paper, we first describe both temporal and spatial approaches, describe the methods to select various hyperparameters, and then show a workflow to combine these two methodologies and provide comparative results. Our results illustrate that the average precision of temporal methods using long-short temporal memory networks to predict impending failures in the next ten days was 84 percent.

Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9% and 65.1% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time. Additionally, there was a significant difference in ridership decline between the highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77% vs 58%) in Nashville.","tags":[],"title":"Transit-Gym: A Simulation and Evaluation Engine for Analysis of Bus Transit Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francis Tiausas","Jose Paolo Talusan","Yu Ishimaki","Hayato Yamana","Hirozumi Yamaguchi","Shameek Bhattacharjee","Abhishek Dubey","Keiichi Yasumoto","Sajal K.

This pattern has overwhelmed the emergency services with limited resources and demands the optimization of response processes. It is partly due to traditional `reactive' approach of emergency services to collect data about incidents, where a source initiates a call to the emergency number (e.g., 911 in U.S.), delaying and limiting the potentially optimal response. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze provides an opportunity to develop a rapid, `proactive' approach to collect data about incidents through crowd-generated observational reports. However, the reliability of reporting sources and spatio-temporal uncertainty of the reported incidents challenge the design of such a proactive approach. Thus, this paper presents a novel method for emergency incident detection using noisy crowdsourced Waze data. We propose a principled computational framework based on Bayesian theory to model the uncertainty in the reliability of crowd-generated reports and their integration across space and time to detect incidents. Extensive experiments using data collected from Waze and the official reported incidents in Nashville, Tenessee in the U.S. show our method can outperform strong baselines for both F1-score and AUC. The application of this work provides an extensible framework to incorporate different noisy data sources for proactive incident detection to improve and optimize emergency response operations in our communities.","tags":[""],"title":"Emergency Incident Detection from Crowdsourced Waze Data using Bayesian Information Fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afiya Ayman","Michael Wilbur","Amutheezan Sivagnanam","Philip Pugliese","Abhishek Dubey","Aron Laszka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130357,"objectID":"4362ef6bde7720df22b5fafe6c821c8f","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/lasz-2006-data/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:17.789248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lasz-2006-data/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to increasing concerns about environmental impact, operating costs, and energy security, public transit agencies are seeking to reduce their fuel use by employing electric vehicles (EVs). However, because of the high upfront cost of EVs, most agencies can afford only mixed fleets of internal-combustion and electric vehicles. Making the best use of these mixed fleets presents a challenge for agencies since optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, etc. require accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and machine learning enable remedying this situation; however, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data into a route-level prediction model for public transit. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of route-level energy use for mixed-vehicle transit fleets, which we evaluate using data collected from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit authority of Chattanooga, TN. We present a data collection and storage framework, which we use to capture system-level data, including traffic and weather conditions, and high-frequency vehicle-level data, including location traces, fuel or electricity use, etc. We present domain-specific methods and algorithms for integrating and cleansing data from various sources, including street and elevation maps. Finally, we train and evaluate machine learning models, including deep neural networks, decision trees, and linear regression, on our integrated dataset.

However, the quality of the DL models can degrade over time due to changes in the input data distribution, thereby requiring periodic model updates. Although cloud data-centers can meet the computational requirements of the resource-intensive and time-consuming model update task, transferring data from the edge devices to the cloud incurs a significant cost in terms of network bandwidth and are prone to data privacy issues. With the advent of GPU-enabled edge devices, the DL model update can be performed at the edge in a distributed manner using multiple connected edge devices. However, efficiently utilizing the edge resources for the model update is a hard problem due to the heterogeneity among the edge devices and the resource interference caused by the co-location of the DL model update task with latency-critical tasks running in the background. To overcome these challenges, we present Deep-Edge, a load- and interference-aware, fault-tolerant resource management framework for performing model update at the edge that uses distributed training. This paper makes the following contributions. First, it provides a unified framework for monitoring, profiling, and deploying the DL model update tasks on heterogeneous edge devices. Second, it presents a scheduler that reduces the total re-training time by appropriately selecting the edge devices and distributing data among them such that no latency-critical applications experience deadline violations. Finally, we present empirical results to validate the efficacy of the framework using a real-world DL model update case-study based on the Caltech dataset and an edge AI cluster testbed.","tags":[],"title":"Deep-Edge: An Efficient Framework for Deep Learning Model Update on Heterogeneous Edge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V.

We present a grid aware decision-theoretic framework for electric bus charge scheduling that accounts for energy price and grid load. The framework co-simulates models for traffic (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and the electric grid (GridLAB-D), which are used by a decision-theoretic planner to evaluate charging decisions with regard to their long-term effect on grid reliability and cost.

The chronological order of attacks enables us to uncover those attack combinations that can cause severe system damage but this concept remained unexplored due to the lack of dynamic attack models. Motivated by the idea, we consider a game-theoretic approach to design a new attacker-defender model for power systems. Here, the attacker can strategically identify the chronological order in which the critical substations and their protection assemblies can be attacked in order to maximize the overall system damage. However, the defender can intelligently identify the critical substations to protect such that the system damage can be minimized.

A typical smart home will contain a variety of sensors, actuators (e.g. for opening doors), communication links, storage devices, video cameras, network interfaces, and control units. Each of these physical components and subsystems must be secure in order for the overall system to be secure. Typical security analysis focuses on the defined interfaces of the system: network security via firewalls, communications encryption, and authentication at terminals. Unfortunately, many of these devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) space are susceptible to physical attacks via electromagnetic energy, or other sound/heat energy. Properly designed electromagnetic (EM) waveforms can access a range of vulnerabilities, providing unanticipated entry points into the system. In this chapter, we discuss a multi-modeling methodology for analyzing cyber-physical vulnerabilities, assessing the system across geometry, electronic, and behavioral domains. A home automation system is used as an example, showing a methodology for assessing vulnerabilities in hardware. The example exploits the use of EM energy injection. A multi-modeling of the system captures the geometric structure of the hardware with links to behavioral models. Low-energy EM pathways are discovered that may impact system behavior. Computation is minimized by applying analysis of EM effects only at behavior-critical inputs and outputs. The chapter also discusses a methodology for system-level impact analysis. The final conclusion is that susceptibility to physical layer presents many attack surfaces, due to a large number of heterogeneous IoT devices, mandating consideration of the physical dimensions to vulnerability analysis and risk mitigation.","tags":[""],"title":"Cyber-Physical Vulnerability Analysis of IoT Applications Using Multi-Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Barbour","Michael Wilbur","Ricardo Sandoval","Caleb Van Geffen","Brandon Hall","Abhishek Dubey","Dan Work"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130359,"objectID":"1b23ae4f0ed8c5d15d4e48844b533445","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/micromobility-2020/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:19.489962Z","relpermalink":"/publication/micromobility-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Proliferation of shared urban mobility devices (SUMDs), particularly dockless e-scooters, has created opportunities for users with efficient, short trips, but raised management challenges for cities and regulators in terms of safety, infrastructure, and parking. There is a need in some high-demand areas for dedicated parking locations for dockless e-scooters and other devices. We propose the use of data generated by SUMD trips for establishing locations of parking facilities and assessing their required capacity and anticipated utilization. The problem objective is: find locations for a given number of parking facilities that maximize the number of trips that could reasonably be ended and parked at these facilities. Posed another way, what is the minimum number and best locations of parking facilities needed to cover a desired portion of trips at these facilities? In order to determine parking locations, areas of high-density trip destination points are found using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The dwell time of each device is used to estimate the number of devices parked in a location over time and the necessary capacity of the parking facility. The methodology is tested on a dataset of approximately 100,000 e-scooter trips at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. We find DBSCAN to be the most effective algorithm at determining high-performing parking locations. A selection of 19 parking locations, is enough to capture roughly 25 percent of all trips in the dataset.

The simple design approach, and their capability to continuously learn has led to their widespread use in different autonomous applications. Despite their simplicity and impressive capabilities, these components are difficult to assure, which makes their use challenging. The problem of assuring CPS with untrusted controllers has been achieved using the Simplex Architecture. This architecture integrates the system to be assured with a safe controller and provides a decision logic to switch between the decisions of these controllers. However, the key challenges in using the Simplex Architecture are: (1) designing an effective decision logic, and (2) sudden transitions between controller decisions lead to inconsistent system performance. To address these research challenges, we make three key contributions: (1) dynamic-weighted simplex strategy – we introduce “weighted simplex strategy” as the weighted ensemble extension of the classical Simplex Architecture. We then provide a reinforcement learning based mechanism to find dynamic ensemble weights, (2) middleware framework – we design a framework that allows the use of the dynamic-weighted simplex strategy, and provides a resource manager to monitor the computational resources, and (3) hardware testbed – we design a remote-controlled car testbed called DeepNNCar to test and demonstrate the aforementioned key concepts. Using the hardware, we show that the dynamic-weighted simplex strategy has 60% fewer out-of-track occurrences (soft constraint violations), while demonstrating higher optimized speed (performance) of 0.4 m/s during indoor driving than the original LEC driven system.","tags":[""],"title":"Dynamic-weighted simplex strategy for learning enabled cyber physical systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Wilbur","Afiya Ayman","Anna Ouyang","Vincent Poon","Riyan Kabir","Abhiram Vadali","Philip Pugliese","Daniel Freudberg","Aron Laszka","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130353,"objectID":"ddaefc2e29b3ab6d72cd3fc8db3e94c3","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/wilbur-2020-impact/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:13.640695Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wilbur-2020-impact/","section":"publication","summary":"Public transit is central to cultivating equitable communities. Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9% and 65.1% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time.

By contrast, an open market of computational resources, where resource owners and resource users trade directly with each other, could lead to greater participation and more competitive pricing. To provide an open market, we introduce MODiCuM, a decentralized system for outsourcing computation. MODiCuM deters participants from misbehaving-which is a key problem in decentralized systems-by resolving disputes via dedicated mediators and by imposing enforceable fines. However, unlike other decentralized outsourcing solutions, MODiCuM minimizes computational overhead since it does not require global trust in mediation results.

Despite its importance, it is common for ERM systems to follow myopic and straight-forward decision policies in the real world. Principled approaches to aid decision-making under uncertainty have been explored in this context but have failed to be accepted into real systems. We identify a key issue impeding their adoption --- algorithmic approaches to emergency response focus on reactive, post-incident dispatching actions, i.e. optimally dispatching a responder after incidents occur. However, the critical nature of emergency response dictates that when an incident occurs, first responders always dispatch the closest available responder to the incident. We argue that the crucial period of planning for ERM systems is not post-incident, but between incidents. However, this is not a trivial planning problem -  a major challenge with dynamically balancing the spatial distribution of responders is the complexity of the problem. An orthogonal problem in ERM systems is to plan under limited communication, which is particularly important in disaster scenarios that affect communication networks. We address both the problems by proposing two partially decentralized multi-agent planning algorithms that utilize heuristics and the structure of the dispatch problem.  We evaluate our proposed approach using real-world data, and find that in several contexts, dynamic re-balancing the spatial distribution of emergency responders reduces both the average response time as well as its variance.

Second, we assign route planning tasks to the grids in the sequence. Keeping in mind RSU load and constraints, tasks can be allocated and executed in any non-optimal grid but with lower accuracy. We evaluate this system using Metropolitan Nashville road traffic data. We divided the area into 500 grids, configuring load and neighborhood sizes to meet delay constraints while maximizing model accuracy.

In a cyber-physical manufacturing process, the product quality predictions may be affected by uncertainty sources from the computing subsystem (resource and communication uncertainty), manufacturing process (input uncertainty, process variability and modeling errors), and sensors (measurement uncertainty). In addition, due to the continuous interactions between the computing subsystem and the manufacturing process, these uncertainty sources may aggregate and compound over time.

Thus, to guarantee the resiliency of the system, it is necessary to identifythe root cause(s) of a given system disturbance to take appropriate control actions. Correct failure diagnosis in such systems depends upon an integrated fault model of the system that captures the effect of faults in CPS as well as nominal and faulty operation of protection devices, sensors, and actuators.

Road side units (RSU), Internet of Things (IoT) devices within a city, offer an opportunity to offload computation to the edge. To provide an environment for processing on RSUs, we introduce RSU-Edge, a distributed edge computing system for RSUs. We design and develop a decentralized route planning service over RSU-Edge. In the service, the city is divided into grids and assigned an RSU. Users send trip queries to the service and obtain routes. For maximum accuracy, tasks must be allocated to optimal RSUs. However, this overloads RSUs, increasing delay. To reduce delays, tasks may be reallocated from overloaded RSUs to its neighbors. The distance between the optimal and actual allocation causes accuracy loss due to stale data. The problem is identifying the most efficient allocation of tasks such that response constraints are met while maintaining acceptable accuracy. We created the system and present an analysis of a case study in Nashville, Tennessee that shows the effect of our algorithm on route accuracy and query response, given varying neighbor levels.

IoT services that cater to user mobility, however, face a number of challenges in this context. First, since user mobility can incur wireless connectivity issues, executing these services entirely on edge resources, such as smartphones, will result in a rapid drain in the battery charge. In contrast, executing these services entirely on fog resources, such as cloudlets or micro data centers, will incur higher communication costs and increased latencies in the face of fluctuating wireless connectivity and signal strength. Second, a high degree of multi-tenancy on fog resources involving different IoT services can lead to performance interference issues due to resource contention. In order to address these challenges, this paper describes URMILA, which makes dynamic resource management decisions to achieve effective trade-offs between using the fog and edge resources yet ensuring that the latency requirements of the IoT services are met. We evaluate URMILAtextquoterights capabilities in the context of a real-world use case on an emulated but realistic IoT testbed.","tags":[""],"title":"URMILA: Dynamically Trading-off Fog and Edge Resources for Performance and Mobility-Aware IoT Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sanchita Basak","Afiya Aman","Aron Laszka","Abhishek Dubey","Bruno Leao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130369,"objectID":"d6705d137426b8fbce255fd45ff05c26","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/basak-2019-b/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:28.855759Z","relpermalink":"/publication/basak-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Traffic networks are one of the most critical infrastructures for any community. The increasing integration of smart and connected sensors in traffic networks provides researchers with unique opportunities to study the dynamics of this critical community infrastructure. Our focus in this paper is on the failure dynamics of traffic networks. By failure, we mean in this domain the hindrance of the normal operation of a traffic network due to cyber anomalies or physical incidents that cause cascaded congestion throughout the network. We are specifically interested in analyzing the cascade effects of traffic congestion caused by physical incidents, focusing on developing mechanisms to isolate and identify the source of a congestion. To analyze failure propagation, it is crucial to develop (a) monitors that can identify an anomaly and (b) a model to capture the dynamics of anomaly propagation. In this paper, we use real traffic data from Nashville, TN to demonstrate a novel anomaly detector and a Timed Failure Propagation Graph based diagnostics mechanism.  Our novelty lies in the ability to capture the the spatial information and the interconnections of the traffic network as well as the use of recurrent neural network architectures to learn and predict the operation of a graph edge as a function of its immediate peers, including both incoming and outgoing branches.    Our results show that our LSTM-based traffic-speed predictors attain an average mean squared error of $6.55times10^-4$ on predicting normalized traffic speed, while Gaussian Process Regression based predictors attain a much higher average mean squared error of $1.78times10^-2$. We are also able to detect anomalies with high precision and recall, resulting in an AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.8507 for the precision-recall curve. To study physical traffic incidents, we augment the real data with simulated data generated using SUMO, a traffic simulator.  Finally, we analyzed the cascading effect of the congestion propagation by formulating the problem as  a Timed Failure Propagation Graph, which led us in identifying the source of a failure/congestion accurately.","tags":[""],"title":"Data-Driven Detection of Anomalies and Cascading Failures in Traffic Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aron Laszka","Anastasia Mavridou","Scott Eisele","Emmanouela Statchtiari","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130359,"objectID":"bd9708d15e94d0c930463d6607bc59f8","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/laszka-verisolid-2019/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:19.678373Z","relpermalink":"/publication/laszka-verisolid-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The adoption of blockchain based platforms is rising rapidly. Their popularity is explained by their ability to maintain a distributed public ledger, providing reliability, integrity, and auditability with- out a trusted entity. Recent platforms, e.g., Ethereum, also act as distributed computing platforms and enable the creation of smart contracts, i.e., software code that runs on the platform and automatically executes and enforces the terms of a contract. Since smart contracts can perform any computation, they allow the develop- ment of decentralized applications, whose execution is safeguarded by the security properties of the underlying platform. Due to their unique advantages, blockchain based platforms are envisioned to have a wide range of applications, ranging from financial to the Internet-of-Things. However, the trustworthiness of the platform guarantees only that a smart contract is executed correctly, not that the code of the contract is correct. In fact, a large number of contracts deployed in practice suffer from software vulnerabilities, which are often introduced due to the semantic gap between the assumptions that contract writers make about the underlying execution semantics and the actual semantics of smart contracts. A recent automated analysis of 19,336 smart contracts deployed in practice found that 8,333 of them suffered from at least one security issue. Although this study was based on smart contracts deployed on the public Ethereum blockchain, the analyzed security issues were largely plat- form agnostic.  Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts present a serious issue for two main reasons. Firstly, smart-contract bugs cannot be patched. By design, once a contract is deployed, its func- tionality cannot be altered even by its creator. Secondly, once a faulty or malicious transaction is recorded, it cannot be removed from the blockchain (“code is law” principle). The only way to roll back a transaction is by performing a hard fork of the blockchain, which requires consensus among the stakeholders and undermines the trustworthiness of the platform. In light of this, it is crucial to ensure that a smart contract is se- cure before deploying it and trusting it with significant amounts of cryptocurrency. To this end, we present the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification and generation of contracts that are specified using a transition-system based model with rigorous operational semantics. VeriSolid provides an end-to-end design framework, which combined with a Solidity code generator, allows the correct- by-design development of Ethereum smart contracts. To the best of our knowledge, VeriSolid is the first framework to promote a model- based, correctness-by-design approach for  blockchain-based smart contracts. Properties established at any step of the VeriSolid design flow are preserved in the resulting smart contracts, guaranteeing their correctness. VeriSolid fully automates the process of verifica- tion and code generation, while enhancing usability by providing easy-to-use graphical editors for the specification of transition sys- tems and natural-like language templates for the specification of formal properties. By performing verification early at design time, VeriSolid provides a cost-effective approach since fixing bugs later in the development process can be very expensive. Our verification approach can detect typical vulnerabilities, but it may also detect any violation of required properties. Since our tool applies verifi- cation at a high-level, it can provide meaningful feedback to the developer when a property is not satisfied, which would be much harder to do at bytecode level. We present the application of VeriSolid on smart contracts used in Smart Energy Systems such as transactive energy platforms. In particular, we used VeriSolid to design and generate the smart contract that serves as the core of the TRANSAX blockchain-based platform for trading energy futures. The designed smart contract allows energy producers and consumers to post offers for selling and buying energy. Since optimally matching selling offers with buying offers can be very expensive computationally, the contract relies on external solvers to compute and submit solutions to the matching problem, which are then checked by the contract.  Using VeriSolid, we defined a set of safety properties and we were able to detect bugs after performing analysis with the NuSMV model checker.","tags":[""],"title":"VeriSolid for TRANSAX: Correct-by-Design Ethereum Smart Contracts for Energy Trading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Dubey","W.

Any holistic approach towards creating a pipeline for effective emergency response must also look at other challenges that it subsumes - predicting when and where incidents happen and understanding the changing environmental dynamics.

While other recent works have focused on applying a generalized data-driven technique on the whole network at once, they often ignore intersection characteristics. On the contrary, we propose a city-wide ensemble of intersection level connected LSTM models and propose mechanisms for identifying congestion events using the predictions from the networks. To reduce the search space of likely congestion sinks we use the likelihood of congestion propagation in neighboring road segments of a congestion source that we learn from the past historical data. We validated our congestion forecasting framework on the real world traffic data of Nashville, USA and identified the onset of congestion in each of the neighboring segments of any congestion source with an average precision of 0.9269 and an average recall of 0.9118 tested over ten congestion events.","tags":[""],"title":"Analyzing the Cascading Effect of Traffic Congestion Using LSTM Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shreyas Ramakrishna","Abhishek Dubey","Matthew P.

However, these LECs do not provide any safety guarantees, and testing them is challenging. In this paper, we introduce a framework that performs weighted simplex strategy based supervised safety control, resource management and confidence estimation of autonomous robots. Specifically, we describe two weighted simplex strategies: (a) simple weighted simplex strategy (SW-Simplex) that computes a weighted controller output by comparing the decisions between a safety supervisor and an LEC, and (b) a context-sensitive weighted simplex strategy (CSW-Simplex) that computes a context-aware weighted controller output. We use reinforcement learning to learn the contextual weights. We also introduce a system monitor that uses the current state information and a Bayesian network model learned from past data to estimate the probability of the robotic system staying in the safe working region. To aid resource constrained robots in performing complex computations of these weighted simplex strategies, we describe a resource manager that offloads tasks to an available fog nodes. The paper also describes a hardware testbed called DeepNNCar, which is a low cost resource-constrained RC car, built to perform autonomous driving. Using the hardware, we show that both SW-Simplex and CSW-Simplex have 40% and 60% fewer safety violations, while demonstrating higher optimized speed during indoor driving around 0.40m/s  than the original system (using only LECs).","tags":[""],"title":"Augmenting Learning Components for Safety in Resource Constrained Autonomous Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Zhang","Douglas C.

Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Raft, ensure that the DLT network collectively agrees on contents stored in the ledger. Information security protocols, such as encryption and hashing, protect data integrity and safeguard data against unauthorized access.  The most popular incarnation of DLT has been used in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, through public blockchains, which requires the application of more robust consensus protocols across the entire network. An example is PoW, which has been employed by Bitcoin, but which is also highly energy inefficient.

However, the focus on formal verification methodologies has meant that less attention has been given toward more traditional testing methodologies, such as unit testing and integration testing. This includes a lack of full support by most, if not all, the major blockchain implementations for testing at scale, except on fully public test networks. This has several drawbacks, such as: (1) The inability to do repeatable testing under identical scenarios, (2) reliance upon public mining of blocks, which introduces unreasonable amounts of delay for a test driven development scenario that a private network could reduce or eliminate, and (3) the inability to design scenarios where parts of the network go down.

Traditional design flows based on domain knowledge and analytical models are often impractical for tasks such as perception, planning in uncertain environments, control with ill-defined objectives, etc. Machine learning based techniques have demonstrated good performance for such difficult tasks, leading to the introduction of Learning-Enabled Components (LEC) in CPS. Model based design techniques have been successful in the development of traditional CPS, and toolchains which apply these techniques to CPS with LECs are being actively developed. As LECs are critically dependent on training and data, one of the key challenges is to build design automation for them. In this paper, we examine the development of an autonomous Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) using the Assurance-based Learning-enabled Cyber-physical systems (ALC) Toolchain. Each stage of the development cycle is described including architectural modeling, data collection, LEC training, LEC evaluation and verification, and system-level assurance.","tags":[""],"title":"CPS Design with Learning-Enabled Components: A Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Zhang","Scott Eisele","Abhishek Dubey","Aron Laszka","Anurag K.

On the one hand, these changes pose a decentralized power system control problem, requiring strategic control to maintain reliability and resiliency for the community and for the utility. On the other hand, they require robust financial markets while allowing participation from diverse prosumers. To support the computing and flexibility requirements of TES while preserving privacy and security, distributed software platforms are required. In this paper, we enable the study and analysis of security concerns by developing Transactive Energy Security Simulation Testbed (TESST), a TES testbed for simulating various cyber attacks. In this work, the testbed is used for TES simulation with centralized clearing market, highlighting weaknesses in a centralized system. Additionally, we present a blockchain enabled decentralized market solution supported by distributed computing for TES, which on one hand can alleviate some of the problems that we identify, but on the other hand, may introduce newer issues.

An important indicator of the quality of service in such infrastructures is on-time performance at stops, with published transit schedules playing an integral role governing the level of success of the service. However there are relatively few optimization architectures leveraging stochastic search that focus on optimizing bus timetables with the objective of maximizing probability of bus arrivals at timepoints with delays within desired on-time ranges. In addition to this, there is a lack of substantial research considering monthly and seasonal variations of delay patterns integrated with such optimization strategies. To address these, this paper makes the following contributions to the corpus of studies on transit on-time performance optimization: (a) an unsupervised clustering mechanism is presented which groups months with similar seasonal delay patterns, (b) the problem is formulated as a single-objective optimization task and a greedy algorithm, a genetic algorithm (GA) as well as a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are employed to solve it, (c) a detailed discussion on empirical results comparing the algorithms are provided and sensitivity analysis on hyper-parameters of the heuristics are presented along with execution times, which will help practitioners looking at similar problems. The analyses conducted are insightful in the local context of improving public transit scheduling in the Nashville metro region as well as informative from a global perspective as an elaborate case study which builds upon the growing corpus of empirical studies using nature-inspired approaches to transit schedule optimization.","tags":[""],"title":"Data-Driven Optimization of Public Transit Schedule","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew P.

In this paper, we used data collected over several months from a transit agency and show how this data can be potentially used to learn patterns of travel time during specially planned events like NFL (National Football League) games and music award ceremonies. The impact of NFL games along with consideration of other factors like weather, traffic condition, distance is discussed with their relative importance to the prediction of travel time. Statistical learning models are used to predict travel time and subsequently assess the cascading effects of delay. The model performance is determined based on its predictive accuracy according to the out-of-sample error. In addition, the models help identify the most significant variables that influence the delay in the transit system. In order to compare the actual and predicted travel time for days having special events, heat maps are generated showing the delay impacts in different time windows between two timepoint-segments in comparison to a non-game day. This work focuses on the prediction and visualization of the delay in the public transit system and the analysis of its cascading effects on the entire transportation network.  According to the study results, we are able to explain more than 80% of the variance in the bus travel time at each segment and can make future travel predictions during planned events with an out-of-sample error of 2.0 minutes using information on the bus schedule, traffic, weather, and scheduled events. According to the variable importance analysis, traffic information is most significant in predicting the delay in the transit system.","tags":[""],"title":"Modeling and Predicting the Cascading Effects of Delay in Transit Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ria Mae Borromeo","Lei Chen","Abhishek Dubey","Sudeepa Roy","Saravanan Thirumuruganathan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130353,"objectID":"ee0e4607a2010fa9bb1e0108f578169a","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/ftw-shonan-2019/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:13.055433Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ftw-shonan-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"On Benchmarking for Crowdsourcing and Future of Work Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Purboday Ghosh","Scott Eisele","Abhishek Dubey","Mary Metelko","István Madari","Péter Völgyesi","Gabor Karsai"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130365,"objectID":"495ff1ce2229a5012eedfc7bfdf9e66a","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/ghosh-2019/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:25.042708Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ghosh-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The vision of the `Smart Grid' assumes a distributed real-time embedded system that implements various monitoring and control functions.

Edge computing often uses devices with low computational capacity, therefore service frameworks and middleware are needed to efficiently compose services. While many frameworks use a top-down perspective, quality of service is an emergent property of the entire system and often requires a bottom up approach.

Transit routes are typically static in nature, i.e., the buses serve well-defined routes; this results in people living in away from the bus routes choose alternate transit modes such as private automotive vehicles resulting in ever-increasing traffic congestion. In the flex-transit mode, we reroute the buses to accommodate high travel demand areas away from the static routes considering its spatio-temporal variation. We perform clustering to identify several flex stops; these are stops not on the static routes, but with high travel demand around them. We divide the bus stops on the static routes into critical and non-critical bus stops; critical bus stops refer to transfer points, where people change bus routes to reach their destinations. In the existing static scheduling process, some slack time is provided at the end of each trip to account for any travel delays. Thus, the additional travel time incurred due to taking flexible routes is constrained to be less than the available slack time. We use the percent increase in travel demand to analyze the effectiveness of the rerouting process. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using real-world travel data for Route 7 operated by the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA).","tags":[""],"title":"Towards demand-oriented flexible rerouting of public transit under uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fangzhou Sun","Abhishek Dubey","Jules White","Aniruddha Gokhale"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130360,"objectID":"da11edd83603ca9a14638f26068460c9","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/sun-2019/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:20.807059Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Public transit is a critical component of a smart and connected community.

One of the key capabilities of these emerging platforms is the ability to create self-enforcing smart contracts. However, the development of smart contracts has proven to be error-prone in practice, and as a result, contracts deployed on public platforms are often riddled with security vulnerabilities. This issue is exacerbated by the design of these platforms, which forbids updating contract code and rolling back malicious transactions. In light of this, it is crucial to ensure that a smart contract is secure before deploying it and trusting it with significant amounts of cryptocurrency. To this end, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a transition-system based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to reason about and verify contract behavior at a high level of abstraction.

Such real-time process monitoring and control techniques are useful in precision and ultra-precision machining processes. However, the output product quality is affected by several uncertainty sources in various stages of the manufacturing process such as the sensor uncertainty, computational system uncertainty, control input uncertainty, and the variability in the manufacturing process. The computational system may be a single computing node or a distributed computing network; the latter scenario introduces additional uncertainty due to the communication between several computing nodes. Due to the continuous monitoring process, these uncertainty sources aggregate and compound over time, resulting in variations of product quality. Therefore, characterization of the various uncertainty sources and their impact on the product quality are necessary to increase the efficiency and productivity of the overall manufacturing process. To this end, this paper develops a two-level dynamic Bayesian network methodology, where the higher level captures the uncertainty in the sensors, control inputs, and the manufacturing process while the lower level captures the uncertainty in the communication between several computing nodes. In addition, we illustrate the use of a variance-based global sensitivity analysis approach for dimension reduction in a high-dimensional manufacturing process, in order to enable real-time analysis for process control. The proposed methodologies of process control under uncertainty and dimension reduction are illustrated for a cyber-physical turning process.","tags":[""],"title":"Real-Time Control of Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Process Under Uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

However, the high volume of unstructured data from the heterogeneous sources with varying degrees of veracity challenges the timely extraction and integration of relevant information to summarize the current situation. Existing work on event detection and summarization on social media relates to this challenge of timely extraction of information during an evolving event. However, it is limited in both integrating incomplete information from diverse sources and using the integrated information to dynamically infer knowledge representation of the situation that captures optimal actions (e.g., allocate available finite ambulances to incident regions). In this paper, we present a novel concept of an Uncertain Concept Graph (UCG) that is capable of representing dynamic knowledge of a disaster event from heterogeneous data sources, particularly for the regions of interest, and resources/services required. The information sources, incident regions, and resources (e.g., ambulances) are represented as nodes in UCG, while the edges represent the weighted relationships between these nodes. We then propose a solution for probabilistic edge inference between nodes in UCG. We model a novel optimization problem for the edge assignment between a service resource to a region node over time trajectory. The output of such structured summarization over time can be valuable for modeling event dynamics in the real world beyond emergency management, across different smart city operations such as transportation.","tags":[""],"title":"Structured Summarization of Social Web for Smart Emergency Services by Uncertain Concept Graph","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajay Chhokra","Abhishek Dubey","Nagabhushan Mahadevan","Gabor Karsai","Daniel Balasubramanian","Saqib Hasan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130374,"objectID":"b2e7e4fc34cb98ec3bb49a2777b59671","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/chhokra-2018-a/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:34.596781Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chhokra-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The resiliency and reliability of critical cyber physical systems like electrical power grids are of paramount importance. These systems are often equipped with specialized protection devices to detect anomalies and  isolate faults in order to arrest failure propagation and protect the healthy parts of the system.  However,  due to the limited situational awareness and hidden failures the protection devices themselves, through their operation (or mis-operation) may cause overloading and the disconnection of parts of an otherwise healthy system. This can result in cascading failures that lead to a blackout. Diagnosis of failures in such systems is extremely challenging because of the need to account  for faults in both the physical systems as well as  the protection devices, and the failure-effect propagation across the system.    Our approach  for diagnosing such cyber-physical systems is based on the concept of Temporal Causal Diagrams (TCD-s) that capture the  timed discrete models of protection devices and their interactions with a system failure propagation graph. In this paper we present a refinement of the TCD language with a layer of independent local observers that aid in diagnosis.

This paper describes a hierarchical architecture which combines data-driven anomaly detection methods with a fine-grained model-based diagnosis and prognostics architecture. At the core of the architecture is a distributed stack of deep neural network that detects and classifies the data traces from nearby satellites based on prior observations. Any identified anomaly is transmitted to the ground, which then uses model-based diagnosis and prognosis framework to make health state estimation. In parallel, periodically the data traces from the satellites are transported to the ground and analyzed using model-based techniques. This data is then used to train the neural networks, which are run from ground systems and periodically updated. The collaborative architecture enables quick data-driven inference on the satellite and more intensive analysis on the ground where often time and power consumption are not constrained. The current work demonstrates implementation of this architecture through an initial battery data set.

We describe the challenges faced in extracting effective training sets from highly unorganized and class-imbalanced big data and establish methods for online predictions with extensive data pre-processing, feature extraction and validation through test sets with unknown remaining useful lives of the hard disks. Our algorithm performs especially well in predicting RUL near the critical zone of a device approaching failure.The proposed architecture is able to predict whether a disk is going to fail in next ten days with an average precision of 0.8435.In future, we will extend this architecture to learn and predict the RUL of the edge devices in the end-to-end distributed systems of smart communities, taking into consideration context-sensitive external features such as weather.","tags":[],"title":"A Data-driven Prognostic Architecture for Online Monitoring of Hard Disks Using Deep LSTM Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saideep Nannapaneni","Abhishek Dubey","Sankaran Mahadevan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130373,"objectID":"09300502096517495878e0504ddc6a4b","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/nannapaneni-2018-a/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:33.412155Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nannapaneni-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[""],"title":"Automated aircraft separation safety assurance using Bayesian networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Subhav Pradhan","Abhishek Dubey","Shweta Khare","Saideep Nannapaneni","Aniruddha S.

Managing applications on these edge resources is hard, however, due to their remote, distributed, and (possibly) dynamic nature, which necessitates autonomous management mechanisms that facilitate application deployment, failure avoidance, failure management, and incremental updates. To address these needs, we present CHARIOT, which is orchestration middleware capable of autonomously managing IoT systems consisting of edge resources and applications. CHARIOT implements a three-layer architecture. The topmost layer comprises a system description language, the middle layer comprises a persistent data storage layer and the corresponding schema to store system information, and the bottom layer comprises a management engine that uses information stored persistently to formulate constraints that encode system properties and requirements, thereby enabling the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to compute optimal system (re)configurations dynamically at runtime.

These devices alter the mode of the system using locally available information in order to stop fault propagation. For example, in electrical networks relays and breakers isolate faults in order to arrest failure propagation and protect the healthy parts of the system. However, these assemblies themselves can have faults, which may inadvertently induce secondary failures. Often these secondary failures lead to cascade effects, which then lead to total system collapse. This behavior is often seen in electrical transmission systems where failures of relays and breakers may cause overloading and the disconnection of parts of an otherwise healthy system. In the past, we had developed a consistency based diagnosis approach for physical systems based on the temporal failure propagation graph. We now describe an extension that uses the concept of timed discrete event observers in combination with the timed failure propagation graphs to extend the hypothesis to include the possibility of failures in the fault protection units.

Edge devices (that we call end or user devices for disambiguation) play the role of personal computers, dedicated to a user and to a set of correlated applications. In this new scenario, the boundaries between the network node, the sensor, and the actuator are blurring, driven primarily by the computation power of IoT nodes like single board computers and the smartphones. The bigger data generated in this type of networks needs clever, scalable, and possibly decentralized computing solutions that can scale independently as required. Any node can be seen as part of a graph, with the capacity to serve as a computing or network router node, or both. Complex applications can possibly be distributed over this graph or network of nodes to improve the overall performance like the amount of data processed over time.

To improve the on-time performance of transit systems, prior work focuses on updating schedule periodically in the long-term and providing arrival delay prediction in real-time. But when no real-time transit and traffic feed is available (e.g., one day ahead), there is a lack of effective contextual prediction mechanism that can give alerts of possible delay to commuters. In this paper, we propose a generic tool-chain that takes standard General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) transit feeds and contextual information (recurring delay patterns before and after big events in the city and the contextual information such as scheduled events and forecasted weather conditions) as inputs and provides service alerts as output. Particularly, we utilize shared route segment networks and multi-task deep neural networks to solve the data sparsity and generalization issues.

These applications provide participants with the capability to exchange not only data but also resources, which raises the concerns of integrity, trust, and above all the need for fair and optimal solutions to the problem of resource allocation. This exchange of information and resources leads to a problem where the stakeholders of the system may have limited trust in each other. Thus, collaboratively reaching consensus on when, how, and who should access certain resources becomes problematic. This paper presents SolidWorx, a blockchain-based platform that provides key mechanisms required for arbitrating resource consumption across different SCC applications in a domain-agnostic manner. For example, it introduces and implements a hybrid-solver pattern, where complex optimization computation is handled off-blockchain while solution validation is performed by a smart contract. To ensure correctness, the smart contract of SolidWorx is generated and verified using a model-based approach.","tags":[""],"title":"SolidWorx: A Resilient and Trustworthy Transactive Platform for Smart and Connected Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chinmaya Samal","Liyuan Zheng","Fangzhou Sun","Lillian J.

Ride-sharing platforms such as Uber and Lyft are becoming a more commonplace, particularly in urban environments. While such services may be deemed more convenient than riding public transit due to their on-demand nature, reports show that they do not necessarily decrease the congestion in major cities. One of the key problems is that typically mobility decision support systems focus on individual utility and react only after congestion appears. In this paper, we propose socially considerate multi-modal routing algorithms that are proactive and consider, via predictions, the shared effect of riders on the overall efficacy of mobility services. We have adapted the MATSim simulator framework to incorporate the proposed algorithms present a simulation analysis of a case study in Nashville, Tennessee that assesses the effects of our routing models on the traffic congestion for different levels of penetration and adoption of socially considerate routes.

Prompted by the increasing complexity of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionality of these solutions is to provide mechanisms for matching producers with consumers while ensuring system safety. However, there are multiple challenges that these solutions still face: privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacy challenge arises because the time series of production and consumption data for each participant is sensitive and may be used to infer personal information. Trust is an issue because a producer or consumer can renege on the promised energy transfer. Providing resilience is challenging due to the possibility of failures in the infrastructure that is required to support these market based solutions. In this paper, we develop a rigorous solution for transactive microgrids that addresses all three challenges by providing an innovative combination of MILP solvers, smart contracts, and publish-subscribe middleware within a framework of a novel distributed application platform, called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid.

Microgrids are sections of the grid that can operate in isolation from the main power system. Maintaining power balance within an islanded microgrid is a challenging task, due to the low system inertia, which requires complex control to maintain stable and optimized operation. Many studies have demonstrated feasible distributed microgrid controllers that can maintain microgrid stability in grid connected and islanded modes. However, there is little emphasis on how to implement these distributed algorithms on a computational platform that allows for fast and seamless deployment.

Modeling a simple system in multiple platforms is a tedious, error prone and time consuming process. This paper describes a domain specific modeling language (DSML) for power systems. It identifies and captures the right abstractions for modeling components in different analysis tools.

The measurements of KPIs are strongly affected by several uncertainty sources such as input material uncertainty, the inherent variability in the manufacturing process, model uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the sensor measurements of operational data. A comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty sources and their effect on the KPIs is required to make the manufacturing processes more efficient. Towards this objective, this paper proposed an automated methodology to generate a hierarchical Bayesian network (HBN) for a manufacturing system from semantic system models, physics-based models, and available data in an automated manner, which can be used to perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis. The semantic system model, which is a high-level model describing the system along with its parameters, is assumed to be available in the generic modeling environment (GME) platform. Apart from semantic description, physics-based models, if available, are assumed to be available in model libraries. The proposed methodology was divided into two tasks: (1) automated hierarchical Bayesian network construction using the semantic system model, available models and data, and (2) automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis. A metamodel of an HBN was developed using the GME, along with a syntax representation for the associated conditional probability tables/distributions. The constructed HBN corresponding to a system was represented as an instance model of the HBN metamodel. On the metamodel, a model interpreter was written to be able to carry out the UQ analysis in an automated manner for any HBN instance model conforming to the HBN metamodel. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated using an injection molding process.","tags":[""],"title":"Automated Uncertainty Quantification Through Information Fusion in Manufacturing Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajay Chhokra","Saqib Hasan","Abhishek Dubey","Nagabhushan Mahadevan","Gabor Karsai"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130377,"objectID":"3a68040e2249e8d182bcf55615790a06","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/chhokra-2017-a/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:36.911564Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chhokra-2017-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Reliable operation of cyber-physical systems such as power transmission and distribution systems is crtiical for the seamless functioning of a vibrant economy.

A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control.

Numerous techniques have been proposed to allocate emergency responders to optimize response times, coverage, and incident prevention. Effective response depends, in turn, on effective prediction of incidents occurring in space and time, a problem which has also received considerable prior attention. We formulate a non-linear mathematical program maximizing expected incident coverage, and propose a novel algorithmic framework for solving this problem. In order to aid the optimization problem, we propose a novel incident prediction mechanism. Prior art in incident prediction does not generally consider incident priorities which are crucial in optimal dispatch, and spatial modeling either considers each discretized area independently, or learns a homogeneous model. We bridge these gaps by learning a joint distribution of both incident arrival time and severity, with spatial heterogeneity captured using a hierarchical clustering approach. Moreover, our decomposition of the joint arrival and severity distributions allows us to independently learn the continuous-time arrival model, and subsequently use a multinomial logistic regression to capture severity, conditional on incident time. We use real traffic accident and response data from the urban area around Nashville, USA, to evaluate the proposed approach, showing that it significantly outperforms prior art as well as the real dispatch method currently in use.","tags":[""],"title":"Prioritized Allocation of Emergency Responders based on a Continuous-Time Incident Prediction Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karla Kvaternik","Aron Laszka","Michael Walker","Douglas C.

While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a transactive microgrid, “prosumers” (i.e., consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system. On the one hand, prosumerstextquoteright personal information must be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. This paper describes Privacypreserving Energy  of cyb (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy.

Furthermore, most state of the art approaches does not consider the effect of weather and the driver of the probe vehicle on the parameters of the learned model.

TT systems have computation and communication constraints, and with the aim to enable secure communications in the network, it is important to evaluate the computational and communication overhead of implementing secure communication mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the effects of adding a Hash-based Message Authentication (HMAC) to TT networked control systems. The contributions of the paper include (1) the analysis and experimental validation of the communication overhead, as well as a scalability analysis that utilizes the experimental result for both wired and wireless platforms and (2) an experimental evaluation of the computational overhead of HMAC based on a kernel-level Linux implementation. An automotive application is used as an example, and the results show that it is feasible to implement a secure communication mechanism without interfering with the existing automotive controller execution times.

Recently, a number of transit agencies have started integrating automated vehicle locators in their fleet, which provides a real-time estimate of the time of arrival. In this paper, we use the data collected over several months from one such transit system and show how this data can be potentially used to learn long term patterns of travel time. More specifically, we study the effect of weather and other factors such as traffic on the transit system delay. These models can later be used to understand the seasonal variations and to design adaptive and transient transit schedules. Towards this goal, we also propose an online architecture called DelayRadar. The novelty of DelayRadar lies in three aspects: (1) a data store that collects and integrates real-time and static data from multiple data sources, (2) a predictive statistical model that analyzes the data to make predictions on transit travel time, and (3) a decision making framework to develop an optimal transit schedule based on variable forecasts related to traffic, weather, and other impactful factors. This paper focuses on identifying the model with the best predictive accuracy to be used in DelayRadar. According to the preliminary study results, we are able to explain more than 70% of the variance in the bus travel time and we can make future travel predictions with an out-of-sample error of 4.8 minutes with information on the bus schedule, traffic, and weather.","tags":[""],"title":"DelayRadar: A multivariate predictive model for transit systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Emfinger","Abhishek Dubey","Péter Völgyesi","János Sallai","Gabor Karsai"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130383,"objectID":"94dde0ce3aa476759a853885843fdd9d","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/emfinger-2016/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T01:59:42.9787Z","relpermalink":"/publication/emfinger-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The emerging CPS/IoT ecosystem platforms such as Beaglebone Black, Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison and other edge devices such as SCALE, Paradrop are providing new capabilities for data collection, analysis and processing at the edge (also referred to as Fog Computing).

A mission is defined as a composition of several high-level functions occurring at different stages and for a specific time during the mission. The high-level functions are decomposed into lower-level functions, which are then mapped to their corresponding components or component assemblies. The reliability block diagram is obtained using functional decomposition and function-component association. Using the reliability block diagram and the reliability information on the components such as failure rates, the reliability of the system carrying out a mission can be estimated. The reliability block diagram is evaluated by converting it into a logic (Boolean) expression. A modeling language created using the Generic Modeling Environment (GME) platform is used, which enables modeling of a system and captures the functional decomposition and function-component association in the system. This framework also allows for real-time monitoring of the system performance where the reliability of the mission can be computed over time as the mission progresses. The uncertainties in the failure rates and operational time of each high-level function are also considered which are quantified through probability distributions using the Bayesian framework. The dependence between failures of components are also considered and are quantified through a Bayesian network (BN). Other quantities of interest such as mission feasibility and function availability can also be assessed using this framework. Mission feasibility analysis determines if the mission can be accomplished given the current state of components in the system, and function availability provides information whether the function will be available in the future given the current state of the system.

However, public bus transit is often difficult to use because of lack of real- time information about bus locations and delay time, which in the presence of operational delays and service alerts makes it difficult for riders to predict when buses will arrive and plan trips. Precisely tracking vehicle and informing riders of estimated times of arrival is challenging due to a number of factors, such as traffic congestion, operational delays, varying times taken to load passengers at each stop. In this paper, we introduce a public transportation decision support system for both short-term as well as long-term prediction of arrival bus times. The system uses streaming real-time bus position data, which is updated once every minute, and historical arrival and departure data - available for select stops to predict bus arrival times. Our approach combines clustering analysis and Kalman filters with a shared route segment model in order to produce more accurate arrival time predictions. Experiments show that compared to the basic arrival time prediction model that is currently being used by the city, our system reduces arrival time prediction errors by 25 percent on average when predicting the arrival delay an hour ahead and 47 percent when predicting within a 15 minute future time window.","tags":[""],"title":"Real-Time and Predictive Analytics for Smart Public Transportation Decision Support System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Dubey","Subhav Pradhan","Douglas C.

In this paper, we propose a framework for formulating the CPS reliability evaluation as a dependence problem derived from the software component dependences, functional requirements and physical system dependences. We also consider sensor failures, and propose a method for estimating software failures in terms of associated hardware and software inputs. This framework is codified in a domain-specific modeling language, where every system-level function is mapped to a set of required components using functional decomposition and function-component association; this provides details about operational constraints and dependences. We also illustrate how the encoded information can be used to make reconfiguration decisions at runtime.

We particularly focus on software heterogeneity arising from availability of various communication middleware. We then present appropriate solutions in the context of a novel domain specific language, which can be used to design resilient systems while remaining agnostic to middleware heterogeneities.

Software components can further amplify heterogeneity since there exists different component models for different domains. Lifecycle management of such distributed, heterogeneous applications is a considerable challenge.  In this paper, we solve this problem by reasoning about these systems as a Software Product Line (SPL) where individual dimensions of heterogeneity can be considered as product variants. To enable such reasoning, first, we present UMRELA (Universal feature-Model for distRibutEd appLicAtions), a conceptual feature model that identifies commonalities and variability points for capturing and representing distributed applications and their target system. This results in a product line of a family of distributed applications. UMRELA facilitates representation of initial configuration point, and the configuration space of the system. The latter represents all possible states the system can reach and is used as an implicit encoding to calculate new configuration points at runtime.

Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very few existing and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution to developers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integrated model-driven development environment that addresses all phases of application lifecycle including design, development, verification, analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, with supporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such a model-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, this paper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMS ML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specific sub-languages.

Since applications with different security classification levels must be supported in these open systems, the system must provide strict information partitioning such that only applications with matching security classifications interact with each other. The anonymous publish/subscribe communication pattern is a powerful interaction abstraction that has enjoyed great success in previous space software architectures, such as NASA's Core Flight Executive. However, the difficulty is that existing solutions that support anonymous publish/subscribe communication, such as the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS), do not support information partitioning based on security classifications, which is a key requirement for some systems. This paper makes two contributions to address these limitations. First, we present a transport mechanism called Secure Transport that uses a lattice of labels to represent security classifications and enforces Multi-Level Security (MLS) policies to ensure strict information partitioning. Second, we present a novel discovery service that allows us to use an existing DDS implementation with our custom transport mechanism to realize a publish/subscribe middleware with information partitioning based on security classifications of applications. We also include an evaluation of our solution in the context of a use case scenario.","tags":[""],"title":"Establishing Secure Interactions across Distributed Applications in Satellite Clusters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The component model facilitates the construction of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a domain-specific modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation.","tags":[""],"title":"Distributed and Managed: Research Challenges and Opportunities of the Next Generation Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tihamer Levendovszky","Abhishek Dubey","William Otte","Daniel Balasubramanian","Alessandro Coglio","Sandor Nyako","William Emfinger","Pranav Srinivas Kumar","Aniruddha S.

The TCD models represent the faults and their propagation as TFPG, the nominal and faulty behavior of components (including local, discrete controllers and protection devices) as Timed Discrete Event Systems (TDES), and capture the cumulative and cascading effects of these interactions. The TCD diagnosis engine includes an extended TFPG-like reasoner which in addition to observing the alarms and mode changes (as the TFPG), monitors the event traces (that correspond to the behavioral aspects of the model) to generate hypotheses that consistently explain all the observations.

Existing component models supported by standardized technologies, such as the OMG's CORBA Component Model (CCM), however, incur a number of limitations in the context of cyber physical systems (CPS) that operate in highly dynamic, resource-constrained, and uncertain environments, such as space environments, yet require multiple quality of service (QoS) assurances, such as timeliness, reliability, and security. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents the design of a novel component model called F6COM that is developed for applications operating in the context of a cluster of fractionated spacecraft. Although F6COM leverages the compositional capabilities and port abstractions of existing component models, it provides several new features. Specifically, F6COM abstracts the component operations as tasks, which are scheduled sequentially based on a specified scheduling policy. The infrastructure ensures that at any time at most one task of a component can be active - eliminating race conditions and deadlocks without requiring complicated and error-prone synchronization logic to be written by the component developer. These tasks can be initiated due to (a) interactions with other components, (b) expiration of timers, both sporadic and periodic, and (c) interactions with input/output devices. Interactions with other components are facilitated by ports.

This spacecraft architecture poses novel software challenges because the hardware platform is inherently distributed, with highly fluctuating connectivity among the modules. It is critical for mission success to support autonomous fault management and to satisfy real-time performance requirements. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple organizations and users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution proposed in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The operating system provides primitives for concurrency, synchronization, and secure information flows; it also enforces application separation and resource management policies. The middleware provides higher-level services supporting request/response and publish/subscribe interactions for distributed software. The component model facilitates the creation of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. Two cross-cutting aspects - multi-level security and multi-layered fault management - are addressed at all levels of the architecture. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a dedicated modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation.","tags":[""],"title":"A software platform for fractionated spacecraft","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qian Chen","R.

The formation of the system-of-systems leads to a new range of faults that manifest at different granularities for which no statically defined fault tolerance scheme applies. Thus, dynamic and adaptive fault tolerance mechanisms are needed which must execute within the available resources without compromising the safety and timeliness of existing real-time tasks in the individual subsystems. To address these requirements, this paper describes a middleware solution called Safe Middleware Adaptation for Real-Time Fault Tolerance (SafeMAT), which opportunistically leverages the available slack in the over-provisioned resources of individual subsystems. SafeMAT comprises three primary artifacts: (1) a flexible and configurable distributed, runtime resource monitoring framework that can pinpoint in real-time the available slack in the system that is used in making dynamic and adaptive fault tolerance decisions, (2) a safe and resource aware dynamic failure adaptation algorithm that enables efficient recovery from different granularities of failures within the available slack in the execution schedule while ensuring real-time constraints are not violated and resources are not overloaded, and (3) a framework that empirically validates the correctness of the dynamic mechanisms and the safety of the DRE system. Experimental results evaluating SafeMAT on an avionics application indicates that SafeMAT incurs only 9-15% runtime fail over and 2-6% processor utilization overheads thereby providing safe and predictable failure adaptability in real-time.","tags":[""],"title":"Reliable Distributed Real-Time and Embedded Systems through Safe Middleware Adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajat Mehrotra","Abhishek Dubey","Sherif Abdelwahed","Krisa W.

In the context of Cloud computing, auto scaling mechanisms hold the promise of assuring QoS properties to the applications while simultaneously making efficient use of resources and keeping operational costs low for the service providers. Despite the perceived advantages of auto scaling, realizing the full potential of auto scaling is hard due to multiple challenges stemming from the need to precisely estimate resource usage in the face of significant variability in client workload patterns. This paper makes three contributions to overcome the general lack of effective techniques for workload forecasting and optimal resource allocation. First, it discusses the challenges involved in auto scaling in the cloud. Second, it develops a model-predictive algorithm for workload forecasting that is used for resource auto scaling. Finally, empirical results are provided that demonstrate that resources can be allocated and deal located by our algorithm in a way that satisfies both the application QoS while keeping operational costs low.","tags":[""],"title":"Efficient Autoscaling in the Cloud Using Predictive Models for Workload Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tripti Saxena","Abhishek Dubey"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130411,"objectID":"e48ba1970c952b748deb0912a7c95d34","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/saxena-2011/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T02:00:10.604766Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saxena-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Scientific workflows require the coordination of data processing activities, resulting in executions driven by data dependencies.

The sequence of participants is described in an abstract parameterized view, which is translated into a concrete data dependency based sequence of participants with defined arguments. As participants belonging to a workflow are mapped onto machines and executed, periodic and on-demand monitoring of vital health parameters on allocated nodes is enabled according to pre-specified rules. These rules specify conditions that must be true pre-execution, during execution and post-execution. Monitoring information for each participant is propagated upwards through the reflex and healing architecture, which consists of a hierarchical network of decentralized fault management entities, called reflex engines. They are instantiated as state machines or timed automatons that change state and initiate reflexive mitigation action(s) upon occurrence of certain faults.

These systems need a reconfiguration mechanism that provides recovery from individual component failures as well as the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving mission goals. One way to provide this functionality is to define a model of alternative system configurations and allow the system to choose the current configuration based on its current state, including environmental parameters and goals. The primary difficulties with this approach are (1) the state space of configurations can grow very large, which can make explicit enumeration infeasible, and (2) the component failures and evolving system goals must be somehow encoded in the system configuration model. This paper describes an online reconfiguration method based on model-based designspace exploration. We symbolically encode the set of valid system configurations and assert the current system state and goals as symbolic constraints. Our initial work indicates that this method scales and is capable of providing effective online dynamic reconfiguration.","tags":[""],"title":"Enabling self-management by using model-based design space exploration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajat Mehrotra","Abhishek Dubey","Sherif Abdelwahed","Asser N.

In this paper, we introduce a model-based hierarchical reliability framework that enables periodic monitoring of vital health parameters across the cluster and provides for autonomic fault mitigation. We also discuss some of the challenges faced by autonomic reliability frameworks in cluster environments such as non-determinism in task scheduling in standard operating systems such as Linux and need for synchronized execution of monitoring sensors across the cluster. Additionally, we present a solution to these problems in the context of our framework, which utilizes a feedback controller based approach to compensate for the scheduling jitter in non real-time operating systems. Finally, we present experimental data that illustrates the effectiveness of our approach.","tags":[""],"title":"Towards A Model-Based Autonomic Reliability Framework for Computing Clusters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Dubey","Sandeep Neema","Jim Kowalkowski","Amitoj Singh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130421,"objectID":"44de838e30357025b184967e37cd5adf","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/dubey-2008/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T02:00:21.160766Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dubey-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"Large scientific computing clusters require a distributed dependability subsystem that can provide fault isolation and recovery and is capable of learning and predicting failures, to improve the reliability of scientific workflows.

The design of appropriate mitigation actions depend upon the goals and state of the application and environment. Strict time deadlines in real-time systems further exacerbate this problem. Any autonomic behavior in such systems must not only be functionally correct but should also conform to properties of liveness, safety and bounded time responsiveness. This paper details a real-time fault-tolerant framework, which uses a reflex and healing architecture to provide fault mitigation capabilities for large-scale real-time systems. At the heart of this architecture is a real-time reflex engine, which has a state-based failure management logic that can respond to both event- and time-based triggers. We also present a semantic domain for verifying properties of systems, which use this framework of real-time reflex engines. Lastly, a case study, which examines the details of such an approach, is presented.","tags":[],"title":"Towards a verifiable real-time, autonomic, fault mitigation framework for large scale real-time systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steven Nordstrom","Ted Bapty","Sandeep Neema","Abhishek Dubey","Turker Keskinpala"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1151712000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675130423,"objectID":"d262fa30d9bcb1e82af2b6e910c9a556","permalink":"https://abhishekdubey.bio/publication/nordstrom-2016/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T02:00:23.195069Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nordstrom-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Embedded computing is an area in which many of the Self-* properties of autonomic systems are desirable.

What is lacking, however, is a user-guided means of healing the system after the initial reflexes have been enacted. This process should be autonomic in the sense that new system configurations can be achieved by defining a priori only a small set of criteria to which the healed system should conform. What follows is an explanation of this technique for guided healing which allows system designers to direct the healing process from a higher level in such a way that the resulting system configurations satisfy their particular needs.

Algorithms are used to specify how the state space of the system model should be explored in order to perform analysis. In ReachLab, both system models and analysis algorithm models are specified in the same framework using Hybrid System Analysis and Design Language (HADL), which is a meta-model based language. The platform allows the models of algorithms to be constructed hierarchically and promotes their reuse in constructing more complex algorithms. Moreover, the platform is designed in such a way that the concerns of design and implementation of analysis algorithms are separated. On one hand, the models of analysis algorithms are abstract and therefore the design of algorithms can be made independent of implementation details. On the other hand, translators are provided to automatically generate implementations from the models for computing analysis results based on computation kernels. Multiple computation kernels, which are based on specific computation tools such as d/dt and the Level Set toolbox, are supported and can be chosen to enable hybrid state space exploration. An example is provided to illustrate the design and implementation process in ReachLab.","tags":[""],"title":"Computation Platform for Automatic Analysis of Embedded Software Systems Using Model Based Approach","type":"publication"}]
