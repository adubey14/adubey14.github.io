							<h3>CHARIOT</h3>
							<p>
								The CHARIOT (Cyber-pHysical Application aRchItecture with Objective-based reconfiguraTion) project, aims to address the challenges stemming from the need to resolve various challenges within extensible CPS. CHARIOT is an application architecture that enables design, analysis, deployment, and maintenance of extensible CPS by using a novel design-time modeling tool and run-time computation infrastructure. In addition to physical properties, timing properties and resource requirements, CHARIOT also considers heterogeneity and resilience of these systems.  The CHARIOT design environment follows a modular objective decomposition approach for developing and managing the system.  Each objective is mapped to one or more data workflows implemented by different software components. This function to component association enables us to assess the impact of individual failures on the system objectives.  
The runtime architecture of CHARIOT provides a universal cyber-physical component model that allows distributed CPS applications to be constructed using software components and hardware devices without being tied down to any specific platform or middleware. It extends the principles of health management, software fault tolerance and goal based design. <br><a href="whitepapers/chariot.pdf">White Paper</a><br>

							<h3>Transit Hub</h3>
							<p>
								In this project, we use the public transit system in the city of Nashville as a case study to develop tools and techniques for collecting the data, modeling and then analyzing these systems. The outcome of this project will be a smart phone application powered by a real-time decision support system that will enable the transit customers to engage more effectively with the system and allow the Metro transit authority to gain a better insight into several key aspects of the system, allowing them to make it more efficient. Please see <a href="http://thub.isis.vanderbilt.edu/">Transit Hub Platform</a><br> for more details. <br><a href="whitepapers/thub.pdf">White Paper</a><br>

							<h3>Diagnostics and Prognostics of Smart Electric Grid</h3>
							<p>
								Reliable operation of cyber-physical systems (CPS) of societal importance such as Smart Electric Grids is critical for the seamless functioning of a vibrant economy. Sustained power outages can lead to major disruptions over large areas costing millions of dollars. Efficient computational techniques and tools that curtail such systematic failures by performing fault diagnosis and prognostics are therefore necessary. The Smart Electric Grid is a CPS: it consists of networks of physical components (including generation, transmission, and distribution facilities) interfaced with cyber components (such as intelligent sensors, communication networks, and control software). In this this project we are developing  new methods to build models for the smart grid representing the failure dependencies in both physical and cyber components. These models will be used to build an integrated system-wide solution for diagnosing faults and predicting future failure propagations that can account for existing protection mechanisms. The original contribution of this work is in the integrated modeling of failures on multiple levels in a large distributed cyber-physical system and the development of novel, hierarchical, robust, online algorithms for diagnostics and prognostics.<br><a href="whitepapers/griddiagnostics.pdf">White Paper</a><br>		 <br><br>

							<h3>Resilient Software Systems</h3>
							<p>
							Software has become a key enabler and integrator for modern systems. Understanding the physical mechanics of software fault propagation is difficult for general class of systems. Without this knowledge, we often see that the software breaks all the time and the system breaks as a result. In this project, we studied technicals, patterns and architectural frameworks to make the software intensive system more resilient. In this work we accepted that software is going to fail and developed techniques that can be used to compare different designs for resiliency. We also studied the tradeoff between redundancy and  runtime reconfiguration in this project. Finally, we designed tools for mapping distributed application configuration models to reliability block diagrams and using the redundancy information to compute resilience metrics used for comparing alternative deployments. More information and the tools are available <a href=https://phab.resos.isis.vanderbilt.edu/>here</a>.<br><br>

							<h3>Distributed Real-time Embedded Managed Systems (DREMS)</h3>
							<p>
								In this project we designed and Implemented a Secure Information Architecture for the DARPA Systems F6 program.
								The information architecture platform  we developed is a layered stack containing a novel real-time operating
								system, middleware and a component layer. This work further enabled Distributed Real-time
								Embedded Managed Systems (DREMS), a special class of distributed embedded computing
								systems that are remotely controlled and managed, but they operate in and are integrated into
								a local physical environment. The complete software platform and a model-driven software
								development toolchain that can be used to design, implement, and operate DREMS can be
								obtained <a href=https://drems.isis.vanderbilt.edu/projects/drems_pub>here</a>. <br><a href="whitepapers/DREMS.pdf">White Paper</a> 								 <a href="whitepapers/DREMSDemo.pdf">Demonstration Scenario</a> <a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/sites/default/files/2013.12.09--Orbiter_Demo.mp4">Demonstration Video</a>

							<h3>Model-Based Software Health Management</h3>
							<p>
								Software complexity has grown to the point that it is necessary to apply the concepts and techniques from system health management. Todayâ€™s advanced software development technologies, especially model-based software development techniques are excellent candidates for bringing together the techniques of model-based fault diagnosis and software engineering. The project developed  techniques for applying model-based techniques for software health management, with special focus on the use of models in run-time. This work is based previous efforts in the area of model-based software development tools, as well as model-based fault diagnostics. During this project we developed an emulator for ARINC-653, the state of the art standard for implementing
								Integrated Modular Architecture in aerospace domain. This emulator was then
								extended to build a component middleware and software health management framework for
								ARINC-653 systems. This approach resulted in a novel two level
								health management architecture that can be applied in the context of a model-based software
								development process. The emulator and the design environment can be downloaded from
								<a href=https://wiki.isis.vanderbilt.edu/mbshm/index.php/Main_Page>here</a>.<br><br>

							<h3>Reliable Workflow Execution Framework for Scientific Computing </h3>
							<p>
							Large computing clusters used for scientific processing suffer from systemic failures when operated over long continuous periods for executing workflows. Diagnosing job problems and faults leading to eventual failures in this complex environment is difficult, specifically when the success of an entire workflow might be affected by a single job failure. In this project, we developed a model-based hierarchical reflex and healing framework that was used to monitor and execute workflows reliably.
							As participants belonging to a workflow were mapped onto machines and executed, periodic and on-demand monitoring of vital health parameters on allocated nodes was enabled according to pre-specified rules. These rules specified conditions that must be true pre-execution, during execution and post-execution. Monitoring information for each participant was propagated upwards through the reflex and healing architecture, which consists of a hierarchical network of decentralized fault management entities, called reflex engines. They were instantiated as state machines or timed automatons that change state and initiate reflexive mitigation action(s) upon occurrence of certain faults.<br><br>

							<h3>Computation Platform for Algorithmic Analysis of Hybrid Systems</h3>
							<p>
								We developed a model integrated platform called Reach Lab for specifying and analyzing complex
								hybrid systems with discrete and continuous dynamics during 2003-2005. The platform
								separated the concerns of design and implementation of analysis algorithms by providing abstractions
								of basic analytical operators that can be used to model sophisticated algorithms in a
								tool-neutral manner. These algorithms could then be translated to generate implementations
								for different hybrid system analysis tools.<br><br>
