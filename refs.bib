MCTS is often considered challenging to interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process.

The approach uses Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) that are controlled in simulation through reinforcement learning and non-reinforcement learning controllers, and compares their performance with a pure human driving scenario that has no control latency. We measure the performances with respect to average traffic speed (aspect of traffic mobility), traffic speed standard deviation (aspect of traffic smoothness), and percentage of compliance with a custom designed safety monitor (aspect of traffic safety). The work shows that reinforcement learned controllers can perform with almost no deterioration in performance with latencies of 1 s or less. Non-reinforcement learning controllers, which are not intentionally modeled with latency in mind, show rapid deterioration in performance with any unexpected latency, which shows that the motivating problem requires a solution that is robust to latency. The paper discusses the training and reward function modifications required in order to consider latency as part of the framework, and discusses how the results may be suitable for deployment on high-latency networks such as mobile phones, without a 5G deployment.},

  abstract      = {Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is one of the most capa- ble online search algorithms for sequential planning tasks, with sig- nificant applications in areas such as resource allocation and transit planning. Despite its strong performance in real-world deployment, the inherent complexity of MCTS makes it challenging to understand for users without technical background. This paper considers the use of MCTS in transportation routing services, where the algorithm is integrated to develop optimized route plans. These plans are required to meet a range of constraints and requirements simultaneously, fur- ther complicating the task of explaining the algorithm’s operation in real-world contexts. To address this critical research gap, we intro- duce a novel computation tree logic-based explainer for MCTS. Our framework begins by taking user-defined requirements and translat- ing them into rigorous logic specifications through the use of lan- guage templates. Then, our explainer incorporates a logic verifica- tion and quantitative evaluation module that validates the states and actions traversed by the MCTS algorithm. The outcomes of this anal- ysis are then rendered into human-readable descriptive text using a second set of language templates. The user satisfaction of our ap- proach was assessed through a survey with 82 participants. The re- sults indicated that our explanatory approach significantly outper- forms other baselines in user preference.},

However, as time progresses, edge/IoT-based FL faces challenges such as unpredictable concept drift, leading to model performance degradation and the need for frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a federated learning framework designed for heterogeneous IoT devices, capable of handling continuous data distribution changes while accounting for limited storage resources. Our framework introduces a server-side drift detection method to minimize bandwidth usage and optimize retraining times, conserving IoT device resources. We also present an efficient storage management strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by selectively managing incoming data streams within device constraints. Additionally, we develop an exemplar-based online continual learning algorithm that leverages class prototypes in the deep feature space to further combat catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on image classification tasks using ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets across four model architectures, demonstrating significant improvements in adaptation to concept drift and long-term performance stability compared to baseline FL approaches.},

  abstract     = {An emergency responder management (ERM) system dispatches responders, such as ambulances, when it receives requests for medical aid. ERM systems can also proactively reposition responders between predesignated waiting locations to cover any gaps that arise due to the prior dispatch of responders or significant changes in the distribution of anticipated requests. Optimal repositioning is computationally challenging due to the exponential number of ways to allocate responders between locations and the uncertainty in future requests. The state-of-the-art approach in proactive repositioning is a hierarchical approach based on spatial decomposition and online Monte Carlo tree search, which may require minutes of computation for each decision in a domain where seconds can save lives. We address the issue of long decision times by introducing a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach, based on the same hierarchical decomposition, but replacing online search with learning. To address the computational challenges posed by large, variable-dimensional, and discrete state and action spaces, we propose: (1) actor-critic based agents that incorporate transformers to handle variable-dimensional states and actions, (2) projections to fixed-dimensional observations to handle complex states, and (3) combinatorial techniques to map continuous actions to discrete allocations. We evaluate our approach using realworld data from two U.S. cities, Nashville, TN and Seattle, WA. Our experiments show that compared to the state of the art, our approach reduces computation time per decision by three orders of magnitude, while also slightly reducing average ambulance response time by 5 seconds.},

  abstract     = {The increasing popularity of electronic vehicles has spurred a demand for EV charging infrastructure. In the United States alone, over 160,000 public and private charging ports have been installed. This has stoked fear of potential grid issues in the future. Meanwhile, companies, specifically building owners are also seeing the opportunity to leverage EV batteries as energy stores to serve as buffers against the electric grid. The main idea is to influence and control charging behavior to provide a certain level of energy resiliency and demand responsiveness to the building from grid events while ensuring that they meet the demands of EV users.  However, managing and co-optimizing energy requirements of EVs and cost-saving measures of building owners is a difficult task. First, user behavior and grid uncertainty contribute greatly to the potential effectiveness of different policies.  Second, different charger configurations can have drastically different effects on the cost. Therefore, we propose a complete end-to-end discrete event simulator for vehicle-to-building charging optimization. This software is aimed at building owners and EV manufacturers such as Nissan, looking to deploy their charging stations with state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. We provide a complete solution that allows the owners to train, evaluate, introduce uncertainty, and benchmark policies on their datasets. Lastly, we discuss the potential for extending our work with other vehicle-to-grid deployments.},

  abstract     = {Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a general mathematical model for sequential decision-making in stochastic environments under state uncertainty. POMDPs are often solved online, which enables the algorithm to adapt to new information in real time. Online solvers typically use bootstrap particle filters based on importance resampling for updating the belief distribution. Since directly sampling from the ideal state distribution given the latest observation and previous state is infeasible, particle filters approximate the posterior belief distribution by propagating states and adjusting weights through prediction and resampling steps. However, in practice, the importance resampling technique often leads to particle degeneracy and sample impoverishment when the state transition model poorly aligns with the posterior belief distribution, especially when the received observation is noisy. We propose an approach that constructs a sequence of bridge distributions between the state-transition and optimal distributions through iterative Monte Carlo steps, better accommodating noisy observations in online POMDP solvers. Our algorithm demonstrates significantly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated across multiple challenging POMDP domains.},

  abstract  = {Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

We explore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting, where an agent must learn how to make decisions based on data collected through a stochastic behavior policy. We present \textit{Latent Macro Action Planner} (L-MAP), which addresses this challenge by learning a set of temporally extended macro-actions through a state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), effectively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs a (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and allows efficient sampling of plausible actions. During planning, our approach accounts for stochasticity in both the environment and the behavior policy by using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In offline RL settings, including stochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete latent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate that L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action dimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with inherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation, L-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs on par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic environments with high-dimensional action spaces.},

This involves optimizing charging and discharging to reduce peak energy costs and net peak demand, monitored over extended periods (e.g., a month), which involves making sequential decisions under uncertainty and delayed and sparse rewards, a continuous action space, and the complexity of ensuring generalization across diverse conditions. Existing algorithmic approaches, e.g., heuristic-based strategies, fall short in addressing real-time decision-making under dynamic conditions, and traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models struggle with large stateaction spaces, multi-agent settings, and the need for long-term reward optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel RL framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient approach (DDPG) with action masking and efficient MILP-driven policy guidance. Our approach balances the exploration of continuous action spaces to meet user charging demands. Using real-world data from a major electric vehicle manufacturer, we show that our approach comprehensively outperforms many well-established baselines and several scalable heuristic approaches, achieving significant cost savings while meeting all charging requirements.

  abstract     = {The Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) involves optimizing routes for vehicles to meet pickup and delivery requests within specific time constraints, a challenge commonly faced in logistics and transportation. Microtransit, a flexible and demand-responsive service using smaller vehicles within defined zones, can be effectively modeled as a PDPTW. Yet, the need for driver breaks—a key human constraint—is frequently overlooked in PDPTW solutions, despite being necessary for regulatory compliance. This study presents a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Driver Breaks (PDPTW-DB). To the best of our knowledge this formulation is the first to consider mandatory periodic driver breaks within optimized Microtransit routes. The proposed model incorporates regulatory compliant break scheduling directly within the vehicle routing optimization framework. By considering driver break requirements as an integral component of the optimization process, rather than as a post-processing step, the model enables the generation of routes that respect hours of service regulations while minimizing operational costs. This integrated approach facilitates the generation of schedules that are operationally efficient and prioritize driver welfare through driver breaks. We work with a public transit agency from the southern USA, and highlight the specific nuances of driver break optimization, and present a Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows formulation for optimizing Microtransit operations and scheduling driver breaks. We validate our approach using real-world data from the transit agency. Our results validate our formulation in producing cost-effective, and regulation-compliant solutions.},

To materialize this, roadside units and ambient transportation sensors are being deployed to collect speed data that enables the monitoring of traffic conditions on each road segment. In this article, we first propose a scalable data-driven anomaly-based traffic incident detection framework for a city-scale smart transportation system. Specifically, we propose an incremental region growing approximation algorithm for optimal Spatio-temporal clustering of road segments and their data; such that road segments are strategically divided into highly correlated clusters. The highly correlated clusters enable identifying a Pythagorean Mean-based invariant as an anomaly detection metric that is highly stable under no incidents but shows a deviation in the presence of incidents. We learn the bounds of the invariants in a robust manner such that anomaly detection can generalize to unseen events, even when learning from real noisy data. Second, using cluster-level detection, we propose a folded Gaussian classifier to pinpoint the particular segment in a cluster where the incident happened in an automated manner. We perform extensive experimental validation using mobility data collected from four cities in Tennessee and compare with the state-of-the-art ML methods to prove that our method can detect incidents within each cluster in real-time and outperforms known ML methods.},

A well-functioning transit system fosters the growth and expansion of businesses, distributes social and economic benefits, and links the capabilities of community members, thereby enhancing what they can accomplish as a society. Since affordable public transit services are the backbones of many communities, this work investigates ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve efficiency and increase utilization from the perspective of transit agencies. This book chapter discusses the primary requirements, objectives, and challenges related to the design of AI-driven smart transportation systems. We focus on three major topics. First, we discuss data sources and data. Second, we provide an overview of how AI can aid decision-making with a focus on transportation. Lastly, we discuss computational problems in the transportation domain and AI approaches to these problems.},

Therefore, transit agencies are looking for ways to adapt to this rapidly changing environment. In this space, ridepooling has the potential to improve efficiency and reduce costs by allowing users to share rides in high-capacity vehicles and vans. Most transit agencies already operate various ridepooling services including microtransit and paratransit. However, the objectives and constraints for implementing these services vary greatly between agencies. This brings multiple challenges. First, off-the-shelf ridepooling formulations must be adapted for real-world conditions and constraints.

  abstract     = {The ability to accurately predict public transit ridership demand benefits passengers and transit agencies. Agencies will be able to reallocate buses to handle under or over-utilized bus routes, improving resource utilization, and passengers will be able to adjust and plan their schedules to avoid overcrowded buses and maintain a certain level of comfort. However, accurately predicting occupancy is a non-trivial task. Various reasons such as heterogeneity, evolving ridership patterns, exogenous events like weather, and other stochastic variables, make the task much more challenging. With the progress of big data, transit authorities now have access to real-time passenger occupancy information for their vehicles. The amount of data generated is staggering. While there is no shortage in data, it must still be cleaned, processed, augmented, and merged before any useful information can be generated. In this paper, we propose the use and fusion of data from multiple sources, cleaned, processed, and merged together, for use in training machine learning models to predict transit ridership. We use data that spans a 2-year period (2020-2022) incorporating transit, weather, traffic, and calendar data. The resulting data, which equates to 17 million observations, is used to train separate models for the trip and stop level prediction. We evaluate our approach on real-world transit data provided by the public transit agency of Nashville, TN. We demonstrate that the trip level model based on Xgboost and the stop level model based on LSTM outperform the baseline statistical model across the entire transit service day.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational chal- lenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets.},

Paratransit services, operated by public transit agencies, are a critical infrastructure that offers door-to-door transportation assistance for individuals who face challenges in using standard transit routes. However, with declining ridership and mounting financial pressure, public transit agencies in the USA struggle to operate existing services. We collaborate with a public transit agency from the southern USA, highlight the specific nuances of paratransit optimization, and present a vehicle routing problem formulation for optimizing paratransit. We validate our approach using real-world data from the transit agency, present results from an actual pilot deployment of the proposed approach in the city, and show how the proposed approach comprehensively outperforms existing approaches used by the transit agency.

In this paper, we introduce Policy-Augmented Monte Carlo tree search (PA-MCTS), which combines action-value estimates from an out-of-date policy with an online search using an up-to-date model of the environment. We prove several theoretical results about PA-MCTS. We also compare and contrast our approach with AlphaZero, another hybrid planning approach, and Deep Q Learning on several OpenAI Gym environments and show that PA-MCTS outperforms these baselines.},

The ability to provide time-synchronized measurements at a fast reporting rate by distribution-level PMUs (D-PMUs) specially with increasing distributed energy resources (DERs) offer great opportunities for monitoring and control. However, unlike the transmission systems, the distribution system waveforms typically have more noise, harmonics and unbalanced phases, posing unique challenges to estimate phasors at the distribution-level. Lack of specific standards for performance requirements of D-PMUs make this further challenging. This work proposes a novel smart synchrophasor device architecture for estimating phasors on polluted signals. The proposed sensor architecture is adaptive to varying system conditions and can adjust reporting rates based on system demands. The proposed approach employs a Sliding Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) and Signal Estimation by Minimizing Parameter Residuals (SEMPR) technique to simultaneously estimate the harmonic components along with the fundamental phasor. Further, to accommodate the signals generated from varying system conditions in the distribution system, an approach is proposed to update the measurement model for the PMU estimation using adaptive filtering and goodness-of-fit (GoF) measure.},

The path planning problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and we propose a novel "Shrinking POMCP" approach to address time constraints. In the AirSim environment, we integrate our approach with a probabilistic world model for belief maintenance and a neurosymbolic navigator for obstacle avoidance. The 2D simulator employs surrogate ROS2 nodes with equivalent functionality. We compare trajectories generated by different approaches in the 2D simulator and evaluate performance across various belief types in the 3D AirSim-ROS simulator. Experimental results from both simulators demonstrate that our proposed shrinking POMCP solution achieves significant improvements in search times compared to alternative methods, showcasing its potential for enhancing the efficiency of UAV-assisted search and rescue operations.},

  abstract  = {Public transportation systems often suffer from unexpected fluctuations in demand and disruptions, such as mechanical failures and medical emergencies. These fluctuations and disruptions lead to delays and overcrowding, which are detrimental to the passengers' experience and to the overall performance of the transit service. To proactively mitigate such events, many transit agencies station substitute (reserve) vehicles throughout their service areas, which they can dispatch to augment or replace vehicles on routes that suffer overcrowding or disruption. However, determining the optimal locations where substitute vehicles should be stationed is a challenging problem due to the inherent randomness of disruptions and due to the combinatorial nature of selecting locations across a city. In collaboration with the transit agency of Nashville, TN, we address this problem by introducing data-driven statistical and machine-learning models for forecasting disruptions and an effective randomized local-search algorithm for selecting locations where substitute vehicles are to be stationed. Our research demonstrates promising results in proactive disruption management, offering a practical and easily implementable solution for transit agencies to enhance the reliability of their services. Our results resonate beyond mere operational efficiency-by advancing proactive strategies, our approach fosters more resilient and accessible public transportation, contributing to equitable urban mobility and ultimately benefiting the communities that rely on public transportation the most.},

  abstract  = {A fundamental challenge in sequential decision-making is dealing with non-stationary environments, where exogenous environmental conditions change over time. Such problems are traditionally modeled as non-stationary Markov decision processes (NS-MDP). However, existing approaches for decision-making in NS-MDPs have two major shortcomings: first, they assume that the updated environmental dynamics at the current time are known (although future dynamics can change); and second, planning is largely pessimistic, i.e., the agent acts "safely'' to account for the non-stationary evolution of the environment. We argue that both these assumptions are invalid in practice-updated environmental conditions are rarely known, and as the agent interacts with the environment, it can learn about the updated dynamics and avoid being pessimistic, at least in states whose dynamics it is confident about. We present a heuristic search algorithm called Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (ADA-MCTS) that addresses these challenges. We show that the agent can learn the updated dynamics of the environment over time and then act as it learns, i.e., if the agent is in a region of the state space about which it has updated knowledge, it can avoid being pessimistic. To quantify "updated knowledge,'' we disintegrate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the agent's updated belief and show how the agent can use these estimates for decision-making. We compare the proposed approach with multiple state-of-the-art approaches in decision-making across multiple well-established open-source problems and empirically show that our approach is faster and more adaptive without sacrificing safety.},

  abstract     = {Time of incident reporting is a critical aspect of emergency response. However, the conventional approaches to receiving incident reports have time delays. Non-traditional sources such as crowdsourced data present an opportunity to detect incidents proactively. However, detecting incidents from such data streams is challenging due to inherent noise and data uncertainty. Naively maximizing detection accuracy can compromise spatial-temporal localization of inferred incidents, hindering response efforts. This article presents a novel human-centered AI tool to address the above challenges. We demonstrate how crowdsourced data can aid incident detection while acknowledging associated challenges. We use an existing CROME framework to facilitate training and selection of best incident detection models, based on parameters suited for deployment. The human-centered AI tool provides a visual interface for exploring various measures to analyze the models for the practitioner’s needs, which could help the practitioners select the best model for their situation. Moreover, in this study, we illustrate the tool usage by comparing different models for incident detection. The experiments demonstrate that the CNN-based incident detection method can detect incidents significantly better than various alternative modeling approaches. In summary, this research demonstrates a promising application of human-centered AI tools for incident detection to support emergency response agencies.},

  abstract = { COVID-19 has radically transformed urban travel behavior throughout the world. Agencies have had to provide adequate service while navigating a rapidly changing environment with reduced revenue. As COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted, transit agencies are concerned about their ability to adapt to changes in ridership behavior and public transit usage. To aid their becoming more adaptive to sudden or persistent shifts in ridership, we addressed three questions: To what degree has COVID-19 affected fixed-line public transit ridership and what is the relationship between reduced demand and -vehicle trips? How has COVID-19 changed ridership patterns and are they expected to persist after restrictions are lifted? Are there disparities in ridership changes across socioeconomic groups and mobility-impaired riders? Focusing on Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, ridership demand and vehicle trips were compared with anonymized mobile location data to study the relationship between mobility patterns and transit usage. Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were used to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and changes in transit ridership, and an analysis of changes in paratransit demand before and during COVID-19. Ridership initially dropped by 66\% and 65\% over the first month of the pandemic for Nashville and Chattanooga, respectively. Cellular mobility patterns in Chattanooga indicated that foot traffic recovered to a greater degree than transit ridership between mid-April and the last week in June, 2020. Education-level had a statistically significant impact on changes in fixed-line bus transit, and the distribution of changes in demand for paratransit services were similar to those of fixed-line bus transit. }

  abstract  = {Public bus transit systems provide critical transportation services for large sections of modern communities. On-time performance and maintaining the reliable quality of service is therefore very important. Unfortunately, disruptions caused by overcrowding, vehicular failures, and road accidents often lead to service performance degradation. Though transit agencies keep a limited number of vehicles in reserve and dispatch them to relieve the affected routes during disruptions, the procedure is often ad-hoc and has to rely on human experience and intuition to allocate resources (vehicles) to affected trips under uncertainty. In this paper, we describe a principled approach using non-myopic sequential decision procedures to solve the problem and decide (a) if it is advantageous to anticipate problems and proactively station transit buses near areas with high-likelihood of disruptions and (b) decide if and which vehicle to dispatch to a particular problem. Our approach was developed in partnership WeGo Public Transit, a public transportation agency based in Nashville, Tennessee and models the system as a semi-Markov decision problem (solved as a Monte-Carlo tree search procedure) and shows that it is possible to obtain an answer to these two coupled decision problems in a way that maximizes the overall reward (number of people served). We sample many possible futures from generative models, each is assigned to a tree and processed using root parallelization. We validate our approach with both real-world and scaled-up data from two agencies in Tennessee. Our experiments show that the proposed framework serves 2\% more passengers while reducing deadhead miles by 40\%. Finally, we introduce Vectura, a dashboard providing transit dispatchers a complete view of the transit system at a glance along with access to our developed tools.},

  abstract     = { Aerial ropeway transit (ART) systems are emerging alternatives to augment existing transit systems in congested cities in the Global South, especially in urban areas with limited transit coverage because of road width constraints or topography. Integration of aerial cable car stations to an existing transit network can improve the overall accessibility of various population segments with significant positive benefits in relation to reducing transport-related social exclusion. This study evaluated the impact of introducing ART in the city of Varanasi (India) and assessed the spatial accessibility improvements to critical facility locations such as heritage sites, educational institutions, hospitals, and employment centers. Several multimodal transit expansion scenarios were considered in this study and the potential benefits of each case were quantified using the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. A multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was subsequently employed for identifying the optimal locations of ART stops. Microlevel analysis findings suggest that the mean accessibility values could increase up to 10.92\% in the first phase of the ART implementation, which could subsequently increase to 24.7\% and 49.8\% for the subsequent transit expansion scenarios. The study also investigated the Varanasi ART DPR prepared by Varanasi Development Authority (VDA) and showed that a significant increase of 16\% in accessibility levels could be achieved if optimal stop locations identified in this study were implemented. The proposed two-step (2SFCA+MCDM) method for identifying the optimal locations of ART stations in a multimodal transit network is expected to be an effective tool for transit system redesign using place-based accessibility measures. },

  abstract   = {Route Planning Systems (RPS) are a core component of autonomous personal transport systems essential for safe and efficient navigation of dynamic urban environments with the support of edge-based smart city infrastructure, but they also raise concerns about user route privacy in the context of both privately owned and commercial vehicles. Numerous high-profile data breaches in recent years have fortunately motivated research on privacy-preserving RPS, but most of them are rendered impractical by greatly increased communication and processing overhead. We address this by proposing an approach called Hierarchical Privacy-Preserving Route Planning (HPRoP), which divides and distributes the route-planning task across multiple levels and protects locations along the entire route. This is done by combining Inertial Flow partitioning, Private Information Retrieval (PIR), and Edge Computing techniques with our novel route-planning heuristic algorithm. Normalized metrics were also formulated to quantify the privacy of the source/destination points (endpoint location privacy) and the route itself (route privacy). Evaluation on a simulated road network showed that HPRoP reliably produces routes differing only by ≤ 20\% in length from optimal shortest paths, with completion times within ∼ 25 seconds, which is reasonable for a PIR-based approach. On top of this, more than half of the produced routes achieved near-optimal endpoint location privacy (∼ 1.0) and good route privacy (≥ 0.8).},

  abstract  = {The offline pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem in the transportation community, which has proven to be very challenging computationally. Due to the complexity of the problem, practical problem instances can be solved only via heuristics, which trade-off solution quality for computational tractability. Among the various heuristics, a common strategy is problem decomposition, that is, the reduction of a large-scale problem into a collection of smaller sub-problems, with spatial and temporal decompositions being two natural approaches. While spatial decomposition has been successful in certain settings, effective temporal decomposition has been challenging due to the difficulty of stitching together the sub-problem solutions across the decomposition boundaries. In this work, we introduce a novel temporal decomposition scheme for solving a class of PDPTWs that have narrow time windows, for which it is able to provide both fast and high-quality solutions. We utilize techniques that have been popularized recently in the context of online dial-a-ride problems along with the general idea of rolling horizon optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve offline PDPTWs using such an approach. To show the performance and scalability of our framework, we use the optimization of paratransit services as a motivating example. Due to the lack of benchmark solvers similar to ours (i.e., temporal decomposition with an online solver), we compare our results with an offline heuristic algorithm using Google OR-Tools. In smaller problem instances (with an average of 129 requests per instance), the baseline approach is as competitive as our framework. However, in larger problem instances (approximately 2,500 requests per instance), our framework is more scalable and can provide good solutions to problem instances of varying degrees of difficulty, while the baseline algorithm often fails to find a feasible solution within comparable compute times.},

  abstract  = {The push to automate and digitize the electric grid has led to widespread installation of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for improved real-time wide-area system monitoring and control. Nevertheless, transforming large volumes of highresolution PMU measurements into actionable insights remains challenging. A central challenge is creating flexible and scalable online anomaly detection in PMU data streams. PMU data can hold multiple types of anomalies arising in the physical system or the cyber system (measurements and communication networks). Increasing the grid situational awareness for noisy measurement data and Bad Data (BD) anomalies has become more and more significant. Number of machine learning, data analytics and physics based algorithms have been developed for anomaly detection, but need to be validated with realistic synchophasor data. Access to field data is very challenging due to confidentiality and security reasons. This paper presents a method for generating realistic synchrophasor data for the given synthetic network as well as event and bad data detection and classification algorithms. The developed algorithms include Bayesian and change-point techniques to identify anomalies, a statistical approach for event localization and multi-step clustering approach for event classification. Developed algorithms have been validated with satisfactory results for multiple examples of power system events including faults and load/generator/capacitor variations/switching
               for an IEEE test system. Set of synchrophasor data will be available publicly for other researchers.},

  abstract  = {As the number of personal computing and IoT devices grows rapidly, so does the amount of computational power that is available at the edge. Since many of these devices are often idle, there is a vast amount of computational power that is currently untapped, and which could be used for outsourcing computation. Existing solutions for harnessing this power, such as volunteer computing (e.g., BOINC), are centralized platforms in which a single organization or company can control participation and pricing. By contrast, an open market of computational resources, where resource owners and resource users trade directly with each other, could lead to greater participation and more competitive pricing. To provide an open market, we introduce MODiCuM, a decentralized system for outsourcing computation. MODiCuM deters participants from misbehaving-which is a key problem in decentralized systems-by resolving disputes via dedicated mediators and by imposing enforceable fines. However, unlike other decentralized outsourcing solutions, MODiCuM minimizes computational overhead since it does not require global trust in mediation results. We provide analytical results proving that MODiCuM can deter misbehavior, and we evaluate the overhead of MODiCuM using experimental results based on an implementation of our platform.}

  abstract   = {Power grids are evolving at an unprecedented pace due to the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DER) in communities. These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results.},

               accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in

  abstract = {Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) have increasingly started using Learning Enabled Components (LECs) for performing perception-based control tasks. The simple design approach, and their capability to continuously learn has led to their widespread use in different autonomous applications. Despite their simplicity and impressive capabilities, these components are difficult to assure, which makes their use challenging. The problem of assuring CPS with untrusted controllers has been achieved using the Simplex Architecture. This architecture integrates the system to be assured with a safe controller and provides a decision logic to switch between the decisions of these controllers. However, the key challenges in using the Simplex Architecture are: (1) designing an effective decision logic, and (2) sudden transitions between controller decisions lead to inconsistent system performance. To address these research challenges, we make three key contributions: (1) dynamic-weighted simplex strategy – we introduce “weighted simplex strategy” as the weighted ensemble extension of the classical Simplex Architecture. We then provide a reinforcement learning based mechanism to find dynamic ensemble weights, (2) middleware framework – we design a framework that allows the use of the dynamic-weighted simplex strategy, and provides a resource manager to monitor the computational resources, and (3) hardware testbed – we design a remote-controlled car testbed called DeepNNCar to test and demonstrate the aforementioned key concepts. Using the hardware, we show that the dynamic-weighted simplex strategy has 60\% fewer out-of-track occurrences (soft constraint violations), while demonstrating higher optimized speed (performance) of 0.4 m/s during indoor driving than the original LEC driven system.}

The images with factors not seen during training is commonly referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD). For safe autonomy it is important to identify the OOD images, so that a suitable mitigation strategy can be performed. Classical one-class classifiers like SVM and SVDD are used to perform OOD detection. However, the multiple labels attached to the images in these datasets, restricts the direct application of these techniques. We address this problem using the latent space of the $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE). We use the fact that compact latent space generated by an appropriately selected $\beta$-VAE will encode the information about these factors in a few latent variables, and that can be used for computationally inexpensive detection. We evaluate our approach on the nuScenes dataset, and our results shows the latent space of $\beta$-VAE is sensitive to encode changes in the values of the generative factor.},

While providing near real-time processing, these state of the art centralized deployments are limited to multiprocessing environments in data centers. This raises privacy concerns, increases risk for critical data and causes vulnerability to network failure. In this paper, we propose to use decentralized road side units (RSU) (owned by the city) to perform route planning. We divide the city road network into grids, each assigned an RSU where traffic data is kept locally, increasing security and resiliency such that the system can perform even if some RSUs fail. Route generation is done in two steps. First, an optimal grid sequence is generated, prioritizing shortest path calculation accuracy but not RSU load. Second, we assign route planning tasks to the grids in the sequence. Keeping in mind RSU load and constraints, tasks can be allocated and executed in any non-optimal grid but with lower accuracy. We evaluate this system using Metropolitan Nashville road traffic data. We divided the area into 500 grids, configuring load and neighborhood sizes to meet delay constraints while maximizing model accuracy. The results show that there is a 30 percent decrease in processing time with a decrease in model accuracy of 99 percent to 92.3 percent, by simply increasing the search area to the optimal grid{\textquoteright}s immediate neighborhood.},

IoT services that cater to user mobility, however, face a number of challenges in this context. First, since user mobility can incur wireless connectivity issues, executing these services entirely on edge resources, such as smartphones, will result in a rapid drain in the battery charge. In contrast, executing these services entirely on fog resources, such as cloudlets or micro data centers, will incur higher communication costs and increased latencies in the face of fluctuating wireless connectivity and signal strength. Second, a high degree of multi-tenancy on fog resources involving different IoT services can lead to performance interference issues due to resource contention. In order to address these challenges, this paper describes URMILA, which makes dynamic resource management decisions to achieve effective trade-offs between using the fog and edge resources yet ensuring that the latency requirements of the IoT services are met.

  abstract  = {Emergency Response Management (ERM) is a critical problem faced by communities across the globe. Despite its importance, it is common for ERM systems to follow myopic and straight-forward decision policies in the real world. Principled approaches to aid decision-making under uncertainty have been explored in this context but have failed to be accepted into real systems. We identify a key issue impeding their adoption --- algorithmic approaches to emergency response focus on reactive, post-incident dispatching actions, i.e. optimally dispatching a responder after incidents occur. However, the critical nature of emergency response dictates that when an incident occurs, first responders always dispatch the closest available responder to the incident. We argue that the crucial period of planning for ERM systems is not post-incident, but between incidents. However, this is not a trivial planning problem -  a major challenge with dynamically balancing the spatial distribution of responders is the complexity of the problem. An orthogonal problem in ERM systems is to plan under limited communication, which is particularly important in disaster scenarios that affect communication networks. We address both the problems by proposing two partially decentralized multi-agent planning algorithms that utilize heuristics and the structure of the dispatch problem.  We evaluate our proposed approach using real-world data, and find that in several contexts, dynamic re-balancing the spatial distribution of emergency responders reduces both the average response time as well as its variance. },

Cyber-attacks are increasing both in number as well as sophistication and these attacks can be strategically organized in chronological order (dynamic attacks), where they can be instantiated at different time instants. The chronological order of attacks enables us to uncover those attack combinations that can cause severe system damage but this concept remained unexplored due to the lack of dynamic attack models. Motivated by the idea, we consider a game-theoretic approach to design a new attacker-defender model for power systems. Here, the attacker can strategically identify the chronological order in which the critical substations and their protection assemblies can be attacked in order to maximize the overall system damage. However, the defender can intelligently identify the critical substations to protect such that the system damage can be minimized. We apply the developed algorithms to the IEEE-39 and 57 bus systems with finite attacker/defender budgets. Our results show the effectiveness of these models in improving the system resilience under dynamic attacks.},

  abstract  = {Proliferation of shared urban mobility devices (SUMDs), particularly dockless e-scooters, has created opportunities for users with efficient, short trips, but raised management challenges for cities and regulators in terms of safety, infrastructure, and parking. There is a need in some high-demand areas for dedicated parking locations for dockless e-scooters and other devices. We propose the use of data generated by SUMD trips for establishing locations of parking facilities and assessing their required capacity and anticipated utilization. The problem objective is: find locations for a given number of parking facilities that maximize the number of trips that could reasonably be ended and parked at these facilities. Posed another way, what is the minimum number and best locations of parking facilities needed to cover a desired portion of trips at these facilities? In order to determine parking locations, areas of high-density trip destination points are found using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The dwell time of each device is used to estimate the number of devices parked in a location over time and the necessary capacity of the parking facility. The methodology is tested on a dataset of approximately 100,000 e-scooter trips at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. We find DBSCAN to be the most effective algorithm at determining high-performing parking locations. A selection of 19 parking locations, is enough to capture roughly 25 percent of all trips in the dataset. The vast majority of parking facilities found require a mean capacity of 6 scooters when sized for the 98th percentile observed demand.},

  abstract  = {The adoption of blockchain based platforms is rising rapidly. Their popularity is explained by their ability to maintain a distributed public ledger, providing reliability, integrity, and auditability with- out a trusted entity. Recent platforms, e.g., Ethereum, also act as distributed computing platforms and enable the creation of smart contracts, i.e., software code that runs on the platform and automatically executes and enforces the terms of a contract. Since smart contracts can perform any computation, they allow the develop- ment of decentralized applications, whose execution is safeguarded by the security properties of the underlying platform. Due to their unique advantages, blockchain based platforms are envisioned to have a wide range of applications, ranging from financial to the Internet-of-Things.
               However, the trustworthiness of the platform guarantees only that a smart contract is executed correctly, not that the code of the contract is correct. In fact, a large number of contracts deployed in practice suffer from software vulnerabilities, which are often introduced due to the semantic gap between the assumptions that contract writers make about the underlying
               execution semantics and the actual semantics of smart contracts. A recent automated analysis of 19,336 smart contracts deployed in practice found that 8,333 of them suffered from at least one security issue. Although this study was based on smart contracts deployed on the public Ethereum blockchain, the analyzed security issues were largely plat- form agnostic. 
               Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts present a serious issue for two main reasons. Firstly, smart-contract bugs cannot be patched. By design, once a contract is deployed, its func- tionality cannot be altered even by its creator. Secondly, once a faulty or malicious transaction is recorded, it cannot be removed from the blockchain ({\textquotedblleft}code is law{\textquotedblright} principle). The only way to roll back a transaction is by performing a hard fork of the blockchain, which requires consensus among the stakeholders and undermines the trustworthiness of the platform. In light of this, it is crucial to ensure that a smart contract is se- cure before deploying it and trusting it with significant amounts of cryptocurrency. To this end, we present the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification and generation of contracts that are specified using a transition-system based model with rigorous operational semantics. VeriSolid provides an end-to-end design framework, which combined with a Solidity code generator, allows the correct- by-design development of Ethereum smart contracts. To the best of our knowledge, VeriSolid is the first framework to promote a model- based, correctness-by-design approach for 
               blockchain-based smart contracts. Properties established at any step of the VeriSolid design flow are preserved in the resulting smart contracts, guaranteeing their correctness. VeriSolid fully automates the process of verifica- tion and code generation, while enhancing usability by providing easy-to-use graphical editors for the specification of transition sys- tems and natural-like language templates
               for the specification of formal properties. By performing verification early at design time, VeriSolid provides a cost-effective approach since fixing bugs later in the development process can be very expensive. Our verification approach can detect typical vulnerabilities, but it may also detect any violation of required properties. Since our tool applies verifi- cation at a high-level, it can provide meaningful
               feedback to the developer when a property is not satisfied, which would be much harder to do at bytecode level. We present the application of VeriSolid on smart contracts used in Smart Energy Systems such as transactive energy platforms. In particular, we used VeriSolid to design and generate the smart contract that serves as the core of the TRANSAX blockchain-based platform for trading energy futures.
               The designed smart contract allows energy producers and consumers to post offers for selling and buying energy. Since optimally matching selling offers with buying offers can be very expensive computationally, the contract relies on external solvers to compute and submit solutions to the matching problem, which are then checked by the contract. 
               Using VeriSolid, we defined a set of safety properties and we were able to detect bugs after performing analysis with the NuSMV model checker.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a data-driven approach for predicting the propagation of traffic congestion at road seg-ments as a function of the congestion in their neighboring segments. In the past, this problem has mostly been addressed by modelling the traffic congestion over some standard physical phenomenon through which it is difficult to capture all the modalities of such a dynamic and complex system. While other recent works have focused on applying a generalized data-driven technique on the whole network at once, they often ignore intersection characteristics. On the contrary, we propose a city-wide ensemble of intersection level connected LSTM models and propose mechanisms for identifying congestion events using the predictions from the networks. To reduce the search space of likely congestion sinks we use the likelihood of congestion propagation in neighboring road segments of a congestion source that we learn from the past historical data. We validated our congestion forecasting framework on the real world traffic data of Nashville, USA and identified the onset of congestion in each of the neighboring segments of any congestion source with an average precision of 0.9269 and an average recall of 0.9118 tested over ten congestion events.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Due to the ever-increasing adaptation of Blockchain technologies in the private, public, and business domains, both the use of Distributed Systems and the increased demand for their reliability has exploded recently, especially with their desired integration with Internet-of-Things devices. This has resulted in a lot of work being done in the fields of distributed system analysis and design, specifically in the areas of blockchain smart contract design and formal verification. However, the focus on formal verification methodologies has meant that less attention has been given toward more traditional testing methodologies, such as unit testing and integration testing. This includes a lack of full support by most, if not all, the major blockchain implementations for testing at scale, except on fully public test networks. This has several drawbacks, such as: (1) The inability to do repeatable testing under identical scenarios, (2) reliance upon public mining of blocks, which introduces unreasonable amounts of delay for a test driven development scenario that a private network could reduce or eliminate, and (3) the inability to design scenarios where parts of the network go down. In this chapter we discuss design, testing methodologies, and tools to allow Testing at Scale of IoT Blockchain Applications.},

  abstract  = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) helps maintain and distribute predefined types of information and data in a decentralized manner. It removes the reliance on a third-party intermediary, while securing information exchange and creating shared truth via transaction records that are hard to tamper with. The successful operation of DLT stems largely from two computer science technologies: consensus mechanisms and information security protocols. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Raft, ensure that the DLT network collectively agrees on contents stored in the ledger. Information security protocols, such as encryption and hashing, protect data integrity and safeguard data against unauthorized access. The most popular incarnation of DLT has been used in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, through public blockchains, which requires the application of more robust consensus protocols across the entire network. An example is PoW, which has been employed by Bitcoin, but which is also highly energy inefficient. Other forms of DLT include consortium and private blockchains where networks are configured within federated entities or a single organization, in which case less energy intensive consensus protocols (such as Raft) would suffice. This chapter surveys existing consensus mechanisms and information security technologies used in DLT.},

  abstract  = {Public transit is a critical component of a smart and connected community. As such, citizens expect and require accurate information about real-time arrival/departures of transportation assets. As transit agencies enable large-scale integration of real-time sensors and support back-end data-driven decision support systems, the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) paradigm becomes a promising approach to make the system smarter by providing online model learning and multi-time scale analytics as part of the decision support system that is used in the DDDAS feedback loop. In this paper, we describe a system in use in Nashville and illustrate the analytic methods developed by our team. These methods use both historical as well as real-time streaming data for online bus arrival prediction. The historical data is used to build classifiers that enable us to create expected performance models as well as identify anomalies. These classifiers can be used to provide schedule adjustment feedback to the metro transit authority. We also show how these analytics services can be packaged into modular, distributed and resilient micro-services that can be deployed on both cloud back ends as well as edge computing resources.},

  abstract  = {Bus transit systems are the backbone of public transportation in the United States. An important indicator of the quality of service in such infrastructures is on-time performance at stops, with published transit schedules playing an integral role governing the level of success of the service. However there are relatively few optimization architectures leveraging stochastic search that focus on optimizing bus timetables with the objective of maximizing probability of bus arrivals at timepoints with delays within desired on-time ranges. In addition to this, there is a lack of substantial research considering monthly and seasonal variations of delay patterns integrated with such optimization strategies. To address these, this paper makes the following contributions to the corpus of studies on transit on-time performance optimization: (a) an unsupervised clustering mechanism is presented which groups months with similar seasonal delay patterns, (b) the problem is formulated as a single-objective optimization task and a greedy algorithm, a genetic algorithm (GA) as well as a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are employed to solve it, (c) a detailed discussion on empirical results comparing the algorithms are provided and sensitivity analysis on hyper-parameters of the heuristics are presented along with execution times, which will help practitioners looking at similar problems. The analyses conducted are insightful in the local context of improving public transit scheduling in the Nashville metro region as well as informative from a global perspective as an elaborate case study which builds upon the growing corpus of empirical studies using nature-inspired approaches to transit schedule optimization.},

In this work, the testbed is used for TES simulation with centralized clearing market, highlighting weaknesses in a centralized system. Additionally, we present a blockchain enabled decentralized market solution supported by distributed computing for TES, which on one hand can alleviate some of the problems that we identify, but on the other hand, may introduce newer issues.

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a flexible rerouting strategy for the public transit to accommodate the spatio-temporal variation in the travel demand. Transit routes are typically static in nature, i.e., the buses serve well-defined routes; this results in people living in away from the bus routes choose alternate transit modes such as private automotive vehicles resulting in ever-increasing traffic congestion. In the flex-transit mode, we reroute the buses to accommodate high travel demand areas away from the static routes considering its spatio-temporal variation. We perform clustering to identify several flex stops; these are stops not on the static routes, but with high travel demand around them. We divide the bus stops on the static routes into critical and non-critical bus stops; critical bus stops refer to transfer points, where people change bus routes to reach their destinations. In the existing static scheduling process, some slack time is provided at the end of each trip to account for any travel delays. Thus, the additional travel time incurred due to taking flexible routes is constrained to be less than the available slack time. We use the percent increase in travel demand to analyze the effectiveness of the rerouting process. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using real-world travel data for Route 7 operated by the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA).},

One of the key capabilities of these emerging platforms is the ability to create self-enforcing smart contracts. However, the development of smart contracts has proven to be error-prone in practice, and as a result, contracts deployed on public platforms are often riddled with security vulnerabilities. This issue is exacerbated by the design of these platforms, which forbids updating contract code and rolling back malicious transactions. In light of this, it is crucial to ensure that a smart contract is secure before deploying it and trusting it with significant amounts of cryptocurrency. To this end, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a transition-system based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to reason about and verify contract behavior at a high level of abstraction. VeriSolid allows the generation of Solidity code from the verified models, which enables the correct-by-design development of smart contracts.},

  abstract  = {The problem of dispatching emergency responders to service traffic accidents, fire, distress calls and crimes plagues urban areas across the globe. While such problems have been extensively looked at, most approaches are offline. Such methodologies fail to capture the dynamically changing environments under which critical emergency response occurs, and therefore, fail to be implemented in practice. Any holistic approach towards creating a pipeline for effective emergency response must also look at other challenges that it subsumes - predicting when and where incidents happen and understanding the changing environmental dynamics. We describe a system that collectively deals with all these problems in an online manner, meaning that the models get updated with streaming data sources. We highlight why such an approach is crucial to the effectiveness of emergency response, and present an algorithmic framework that can compute promising actions for a given decision-theoretic model for responder dispatch. We argue that carefully crafted heuristic measures can balance the trade-off between computational time and the quality of solutions achieved and highlight why such an approach is more scalable and tractable than traditional approaches. We also present an online mechanism for incident prediction, as well as an approach based on recurrent neural networks for learning and predicting environmental features that affect responder dispatch. We compare our methodology with prior state-of-the-art and existing dispatch strategies in the field, which show that our approach results in a reduction in response time with a drastic reduction in computational time.},

It also allows responders to analyze how moving or adding depots (stations for emergency responders) affects average response times, and can make dispatching recommendations based on heuristics.

Traditional design techniques based on domain knowledge and analytical models are often unable to cope with epistemic uncertainties present in these systems. This challenge, combined with recent advances in machine learning, has led to the emergence of Learning-Enabled Components (LECs) in CPS. However, very little tool support is available for design automation of these systems. In this demonstration, we introduce an integrated toolchain for the development of CPS with LECs with support for architectural modeling, data collection, system software deployment, and LEC training, evaluation, and verification. Additionally, the toolchain supports the modeling and analysis of safety cases - a critical part of the engineering process for mission and safety critical systems.},

However, user mobility in such applications imposes a new set of challenges that must be addressed before such applications can be deployed and benefit the society. This paper presents ongoing work on a dynamic resource management middleware called URMILA that addresses these concerns. URMILA ensures that the service remains available despite user mobility and ensuing wireless connectivity issues by opportunistically leveraging both fog and edge resources in such a way that the latency requirements of the service are met while ensuring longevity of the battery life on the edge devices. We present the design principles of URMILA's capabilities and a real-world cognitive assistance application that we have built and are testing on an emulated but realistic IoT testbed.},

These robots use Learning Enabled Components (LECs), trained with deep learning models to perform control actions. However, these LECs do not provide any safety guarantees and testing them is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we have developed an adaptive middleware framework that (1) augments the LEC with safety controllers that can use different weighted simplex strategies to improve the systems safety guarantees, and (2) includes a resource manager to monitor the resource parameters (temperature, CPU Utilization), and offload tasks at runtime. Using DeepNNCar we will demonstrate the framework and its capability to adaptively switch between the controllers and strategies based on its safety and speed performance.},

  abstract  = {Learning enabled components (LECs) trained using data-driven algorithms are increasingly being used in autonomous robots commonly found in factories, hospitals, and educational laboratories. However, these LECs do not provide any safety guarantees, and testing them is challenging. In this paper, we introduce a framework that performs weighted simplex strategy based supervised safety control, resource management and confidence estimation of autonomous robots. Specifically, we describe two weighted simplex strategies: (a) simple weighted simplex strategy (SW-Simplex) that computes a weighted controller output by comparing the decisions between a safety supervisor and an LEC, and (b) a context-sensitive weighted simplex strategy (CSW-Simplex) that computes a context-aware weighted controller output. We use reinforcement learning to learn the contextual weights. We also introduce a system monitor that uses the current state information and a Bayesian network model learned from past data to estimate the probability of the robotic system staying in the safe working region. To aid resource constrained robots in performing complex computations of these weighted simplex strategies, we describe a resource manager that offloads tasks to an available fog nodes. The paper also describes a hardware testbed called DeepNNCar, which is a low cost resource-constrained RC car, built to perform autonomous driving. Using the hardware, we show that both SW-Simplex and CSW-Simplex have 40\% and 60\% fewer safety violations, while demonstrating higher optimized speed during indoor driving around 0.40m/s  than the original system (using only LECs).},

Despite this promise, IoT applications with user mobility face many challenges since offloading the application functionality from the edge to the fog may not always be feasible due to the intermittent connectivity to the fog, and could require application migration among fog nodes due to user mobility. Likewise, executing the applications exclusively on the edge may not be feasible due to resource constraints and battery drain. To address these challenges, this paper describes URMILA, a resource management middleware that makes effective tradeoffs between using fog and edge resources while ensuring that the latency requirements of the IoT applications are met.

  abstract  = {The Internet of Things (IoT) requires distributed, large scale data collection via geographically distributed devices. While IoT devices typically send data to the cloud for processing, this is problematic for bandwidth constrained applications. Fog and edge computing (processing data near where it is gathered, and sending only results to the cloud) has become more popular, as it lowers network overhead and latency. Edge computing often uses devices with low computational capacity, therefore service frameworks and middleware are needed to efficiently compose services. While many frameworks use a top-down perspective, quality of service is an emergent property of the entire system and often requires a bottom up approach. We define services as multi-modal, allowing resource and performance tradeoffs. Different modes can be composed to meet an application's high level goal, which is modeled as a function. We examine a case study for counting vehicle traffic through intersections in Nashville. We apply object detection and tracking to video of the intersection, which must be performed at the edge due to privacy and bandwidth constraints. We explore the hardware and software architectures, and identify the various modes. This paper lays the foundation to formulate the online optimization problem presented by the system which makes tradeoffs between the quantity of services and their quality constrained by available resources.},

Traditional design flows based on domain knowledge and analytical models are often impractical for tasks such as perception, planning in uncertain environments, control with ill-defined objectives, etc. Machine learning based techniques have demonstrated good performance for such difficult tasks, leading to the introduction of Learning-Enabled Components (LEC) in CPS. Model based design techniques have been successful in the development of traditional CPS, and toolchains which apply these techniques to CPS with LECs are being actively developed. As LECs are critically dependent on training and data, one of the key challenges is to build design automation for them. In this paper, we examine the development of an autonomous Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) using the Assurance-based Learning-enabled Cyber-physical systems (ALC) Toolchain. Each stage of the development cycle is described including architectural modeling, data collection, LEC training, LEC evaluation and verification, and system-level assurance.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we focus on application of data-driven methods for remaining useful life estimation in components where past failure data is not uniform across devices, i.e. there is a high variance in the minimum and maximum value of the key parameters. The system under study is the hard disks used in computing cluster. The data used for analysis is provided by Backblaze as discussed later. In the article, we discuss the architecture of of the long short term neural network used and describe the mechanisms to choose the various hyper-parameters. Further, we describe the challenges faced in extracting effective training sets from highly unorganized and class-imbalanced big data and establish methods for online predictions with extensive data pre-processing, feature extraction and validation through online simulation sets with unknown remaining useful lives of the hard disks. Our algorithm performs especially well in predicting RUL near the critical zone of a device approaching failure. With the proposed approach we are able to predict whether a disk is going to fail in next ten days with an average precision of 0.8435. We also show that the architecture trained on a particular model is generalizable and transferable as it can be used to predict RUL for devices in other models from same manufacturer.},

  abstract  = {Public transit agencies are focused on making their fixed-line bus systems more energy efficient by introducing electric (EV) and hybrid (HV) vehicles to their fleets. However, because of the high upfront cost of these vehicles, most agencies are tasked with managing a mixed-fleet of internal combustion vehicles (ICEVs), EVs, and HVs. In managing mixed-fleets, agencies require accurate predictions of energy use for optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, and ensuring that emission standards are met. The current state-of-the-art is to develop separate neural network models to predict energy consumption for each vehicle class. Although different vehicle classes’ energy consumption depends on a varied set of covariates, we hypothesize that there are broader generalizable patterns that govern energy consumption and emissions. In this paper, we seek to extract these patterns to aid learning to address two problems faced by transit agencies. First, in the case of a transit agency which operates many ICEVs, HVs, and EVs, we use multi-task learning (MTL) to improve accuracy of forecasting energy consumption. Second, in the case where there is a significant variation in vehicles in each category, we use inductive transfer learning (ITL) to improve predictive accuracy for vehicle class models with insufficient data. As this work is to be deployed by our partner agency, we also provide an online pipeline for joining the various sensor streams for fixed-line transit energy prediction. We find that our approach outperforms vehicle-specific baselines in both the MTL and ITL settings.},

  abstract  = {The rise in deep learning models in recent years has led to various innovative solutions for intelligent transportation technologies. Use of personal and on-demand mobility services puts a strain on the existing road network in a city. To mitigate this problem, city planners need a simulation framework to evaluate the effect of any incentive policy in nudging commuters towards alternate modes of travel, such as bike and car-share options. In this paper, we leverage MATSim, an agent-based simulation framework, to integrate agent preference models that capture the altruistic behavior of an agent in addition to their disutility proportional to the travel time and cost. These models are learned in a data-driven approach and can be used to evaluate the sensitivity of an agent to system-level disutility and monetary incentives given, e.g., by the transportation authority. This framework provides a standardized environment to evaluate the effectiveness of any particular incentive policy of a city, in nudging its residents towards alternate modes of transportation. We show the effectiveness of the approach and provide analysis using a case study from the Metropolitan Nashville area.},

This is important because communities today are dealing with a number of stresses whose outcomes will ultimately decide the ability to maintain a sustainable and resilient future. This is particularly true of urban environments; their explosive growth is one of the most exciting, yet complex problems of this century. Against this backdrop is the emergence of technologies, both hard and soft, that offer the potential to provide a more intelligent approach to establishing and maintaining livable communities. Smart sensors (e.g., cameras, air quality monitors, geographic positioning) are now embedded in almost every physical device and system we use. This information is being utilized by new modes of networking, algorithms for high-resolution data-driven analysis, and paradigms of distributed computing to perform complex data analytics in support of a safe, secure, efficient, and productive environment.},

  abstract = {Microgrids are seen as an effective way to achieve reliable, resilient, and efficient operation of the power distribution system. Core functions of the microgrid control system are defined by the IEEE standard 2030.7; however, the algorithms that realize these functions are not standardized, and are a topic of research. Furthermore, the corresponding controller hardware, operating system, and communication system to implement these functions vary significantly from one implementation to the next. In this paper, we introduce an open-source platform, Resilient Information Architecture Platform for the Smart Grid (RIAPS), ideally suited for implementing and deploying distributed microgrid control algorithms. RIAPS provides a design-time tool suite for development and deployment of distributed microgrid control algorithms. With support from a number of run-time platform services, developed algorithms can be easily implemented and deployed into real microgrids. To demonstrate the unique features of RIAPS, we propose and implement a distributed microgrid secondary control algorithm capable of synchronized and proportional compensation of voltage unbalance using distributed generators. Test results show the effectiveness of the proposed control and the salient features of the RIAPS platform.},

  abstract    = {Traffic networks are one of the most critical infrastructures for any community. The increasing integration of smart and connected sensors in traffic networks provides researchers with unique opportunities to study the dynamics of this critical community infrastructure. Our focus in this paper is on the failure dynamics of traffic networks. By failure, we mean in this domain the hindrance of the normal operation of a traffic network due to cyber anomalies or physical incidents that cause cascaded congestion throughout the network. We are specifically interested in analyzing the cascade effects of traffic congestion caused by physical incidents, focusing on developing mechanisms to isolate and identify the source of a congestion. To analyze failure propagation, it is crucial to develop (a) monitors that can identify an anomaly and (b) a model to capture the dynamics of anomaly propagation. In this paper, we use real traffic data from Nashville, TN to demonstrate a novel anomaly detector and a Timed Failure Propagation Graph based diagnostics mechanism.  Our novelty lies in the ability to capture the the spatial information and the interconnections of the traffic network as well as the use of recurrent neural network architectures to learn and predict the operation of a graph edge as a function of its immediate peers, including both incoming and outgoing branches.  
                 
                 Our results show that our LSTM-based traffic-speed predictors attain an average mean squared error of $6.55\times10^{-4}$ on predicting normalized traffic speed, while Gaussian Process Regression based predictors attain a much higher average mean squared error of $1.78\times10^{-2}$. We are also able to detect anomalies with high precision and recall, resulting in an AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.8507 for the precision-recall curve. To study physical traffic incidents, we augment the real data with simulated data generated using SUMO, a traffic simulator.  Finally, we analyzed the cascading effect of the congestion propagation by formulating the problem as  a Timed Failure Propagation Graph, which led us in identifying the source of a failure/congestion accurately.},

  abstract    = {An effective real-time estimation of the travel time for vehicles, using AVL(Automatic Vehicle Locators) has added a new dimension to the smart city planning. In this paper, we used data collected over several months from a transit agency and show how this data can be potentially used to learn patterns of travel time during specially planned events like NFL (National Football League) games and music award ceremonies. The impact of NFL games along with consideration of other factors like weather, traffic condition, distance is discussed with their relative importance to the prediction of travel time. Statistical learning models are used to predict travel time and subsequently assess the cascading effects of delay. The model performance is determined based on its predictive accuracy according to the out-of-sample error. In addition, the models help identify the most significant variables that influence the delay in the transit system. In order to compare the actual and predicted travel time for days having special events, heat maps are generated showing the delay impacts in different time windows between two timepoint-segments in comparison to a non-game day. This work focuses on the prediction and visualization of the delay in the public transit system and the analysis of its cascading effects on the entire transportation network.  According to the study results, we are able to explain more than 80\% of the variance in the bus travel time at each segment and can make future travel predictions during planned events with an out-of-sample error of 2.0 minutes using information on the bus schedule, traffic, weather, and scheduled events. According to the variable importance analysis, traffic information is most significant in predicting the delay in the transit system.},

  abstract  = {If last decade viewed computational services as a utilitythen surely this decade has transformed computation into a commodity. Computation is now progressively integrated into the physical networks in a seamless way that enables cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) meet their latency requirements. Similar to the concept of {\textquotedblleft}platform as a service{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}software as a service{\textquotedblright}, both cloudlets and fog computing have found their own use cases. Edge devices (that we call end or user devices for disambiguation) play the role of personal computers, dedicated to a user and to a set of correlated applications. In this new scenario, the boundaries between the network node, the sensor, and the actuator are blurring, driven primarily by the computation power of IoT nodes like single board computers and the smartphones. The bigger data generated in this type of networks needs clever, scalable, and possibly decentralized computing solutions that can scale independently as required. Any node can be seen as part of a graph, with the capacity to serve as a computing or network router node, or both. Complex applications can possibly be distributed over this graph or network of nodes to improve the overall performance like the amount of data processed over time. In this paper, we identify this new computing paradigm that we call Social Dispersed Computing, analyzing key themes in it that includes a new outlook on its relation to agent based applications. We architect this new paradigm by providing supportive application examples that include next generation electrical energy distribution networks, next generation mobility services for transportation, and applications for distributed analysis and identification of non-recurring traffic congestion in cities. The paper analyzes the existing computing paradigms (e.g., cloud, fog, edge, mobile edge, social, etc.), solving the ambiguity of their definitions; and analyzes and discusses the relevant foundational software technologies, the remaining challenges, and research opportunities.},

  abstract  = {An emerging trend in Internet of Things (IoT) applications is to move the computation (cyber) closer to the source of the data (physical). This paradigm is often referred to as edge computing. If edge resources are pooled together they can be used as decentralized shared resources for IoT applications, providing increased capacity to scale up computations and minimize end-to-end latency. Managing applications on these edge resources is hard, however, due to their remote, distributed, and (possibly) dynamic nature, which necessitates autonomous management mechanisms that facilitate application deployment, failure avoidance, failure management, and incremental updates. To address these needs, we present CHARIOT, which is orchestration middleware capable of autonomously managing IoT systems consisting of edge resources and applications. CHARIOT implements a three-layer architecture. The topmost layer comprises a system description language, the middle layer comprises a persistent data storage layer and the corresponding schema to store system information, and the bottom layer comprises a management engine that uses information stored persistently to formulate constraints that encode system properties and requirements, thereby enabling the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to compute optimal system (re)configurations dynamically at runtime. This paper describes the structure and functionality of CHARIOT and evaluates its efficacy as the basis for a smart parking system case study that uses sensors to manage parking spaces.},

We present a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of trip-level energy use for mixed-vehicle transit fleets and for the optimization of vehicle assignments, which we evaluate using data collected from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit agency of Chattanooga, TN. We first introduce a data collection, storage, and processing framework for system-level and high-frequency vehicle-level transit data, including domain-specific data cleansing methods. We train and evaluate machine learning models for energy prediction, demonstrating that deep neural networks attain the highest accuracy. Based on these predictions, we formulate the problem of minimizing energy use through assigning vehicles to fixed-route transit trips. We propose an optimal integer program as well as efficient heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, demonstrating the scalability and performance of these algorithms numerically using the transit network of CARTA.},

  abstract   = {Resource allocation under uncertainty is a classic problem in city-scale cyber-physical systems. Consider emergency response, where urban planners and first responders optimize the location of ambulances to minimize expected response times to incidents such as road accidents. Typically, such problems involve sequential decision making under uncertainty and can be modeled as Markov (or semi-Markov) decision processes. The goal of the decision maker is to learn a mapping from states to actions that can maximize expected rewards. While online, offline, and decentralized approaches have been proposed to tackle such problems, scalability remains a challenge for real world use cases. We present a general approach to hierarchical planning that leverages structure in city level CPS problems for resource allocation. We use emergency response as a case study and show how a large resource allocation problem can be split into smaller problems. We then use Monte Carlo planning for solving the smaller problems and managing the interaction between them. Finally, we use data from Nashville, Tennessee, a major metropolitan area in the United States, to validate our approach. Our experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches used in the field of emergency response.},

  abstract = {Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy and improvements in battery technology. Prompted by the increasing complexity of power systems, decentralized solutions are emerging that arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. This paper addresses the problem of implementing transactive energy mechanisms in a distributed setting, providing both privacy and safety. Specifically, we design and implement an automated auction and matching system that ensures safety (e.g., satisfaction of line capacity constraints), preserves privacy, and promotes local trade and market efficiency for transactive energy systems. This design problem is challenging because safety, market efficiency, and privacy are competing objectives. We implement our solution as a decentralized trading platform built on blockchain technology and smart contracts. To demonstrate the viability of our platform, we analyze the results of experiments with dozens of embedded devices and energy production and consumption profiles using an actual dataset from the transactive energy domain.}

  abstract  = {Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy and improvements in battery technology. Prompted by the increasing complexity of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionality of these solutions is to provide mechanisms for matching producers with consumers while ensuring system safety. However, there are multiple challenges that these solutions still face: privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacy challenge arises because the time series of production and consumption data for each participant is sensitive and may be used to infer personal information. Trust is an issue because a producer or consumer can renege on the promised energy transfer. Providing resilience is challenging due to the possibility of failures in the infrastructure that is required to support these market based solutions. In this paper, we develop a rigorous solution for transactive microgrids that addresses all three challenges by providing an innovative combination of MILP solvers, smart contracts, and publish-subscribe middleware within a framework of a novel distributed application platform, called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid. Towards this purpose, we describe the key architectural concepts, including fault tolerance, and show the trade-off between market efficiency and resource requirements.},

With the advancement in technology and grid automation, power systems are becoming more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The main goal of adversaries is to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and destabilize the system. This paper describes a game-theoretic approach to attacker / defender modeling in power systems. In our models, the attacker can strategically identify the subset of substations that maximize damage when compromised. However, the defender can identify the critical subset of substations to protect in order to minimize the damage when an attacker launches a cyber-attack. The algorithms for these models are applied to the standard IEEE-14, 39, and 57 bus examples to identify the critical set of substations given an attacker and a defender budget.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things and data sciences are fueling the development of innovative solutions for various applications in Smart and Connected Communities (SCC). These applications provide participants with the capability to exchange not only data but also resources, which raises the concerns of integrity, trust, and above all the need for fair and optimal solutions to the problem of resource allocation. This exchange of information and resources leads to a problem where the stakeholders of the system may have limited trust in each other. Thus, collaboratively reaching consensus on when, how, and who should access certain resources becomes problematic. This paper presents SolidWorx, a blockchain-based platform that provides key mechanisms required for arbitrating resource consumption across different SCC applications in a domain-agnostic manner. For example, it introduces and implements a hybrid-solver pattern, where complex optimization computation is handled off-blockchain while solution validation is performed by a smart contract. To ensure correctness, the smart contract of SolidWorx is generated and verified using a model-based approach.},

  abstract  = {The high capacity utilization and the pre-dominantly single-track network topology of freight railroads in the United States causes large variability and unpredictability of train arrival times. Predicting accurate estimated times of arrival (ETAs) is an important step for railroads to increase efficiency and automation, reduce costs, and enhance customer service. We propose using machine learning algorithms trained on historical railroad operational data to generate ETAs in real time. The machine learning framework is able to utilize the many data points produced by individual trains traversing a network track segment and generate periodic ETA predictions with a single model. In this work we compare the predictive performance of linear and non-linear support vector regression, random forest regression, and deep neural network models, tested on a section of the railroad in Tennessee, USA using over two years of historical data. Support vector regression and deep neural network models show similar results with maximum ETA error reduction of 26\% over a statistical baseline predictor. The random forest models show over 60\% error reduction compared to baseline at some points and average error reduction of 42\%.},

To improve the on-time performance of transit systems, prior work focuses on updating schedule periodically in the long-term and providing arrival delay prediction in real-time. But when no real-time transit and traffic feed is available (e.g., one day ahead), there is a lack of effective contextual prediction mechanism that can give alerts of possible delay to commuters. In this paper, we propose a generic tool-chain that takes standard General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) transit feeds and contextual information (recurring delay patterns before and after big events in the city and the contextual information such as scheduled events and forecasted weather conditions) as inputs and provides service alerts as output. Particularly, we utilize shared route segment networks and multi-task deep neural networks to solve the data sparsity and generalization issues. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed toolchain is effective at predicting severe delay with a relatively high recall of 76\% and F1 score of 55\%.},

  abstract  = {Transportation management platforms provide communities the ability to integrate the available mobility options and localized transportation demand management policies. A central component of a transportation management platform is the mobility planning application. Given the societal relevance of these platforms, it is necessary to ensure that they operate resiliently. Modularity and extensibility are also critical properties that are required for manageability. Modularity allows to isolate faults easily. Extensibility enables update of policies and integration of new mobility modes or new routing algorithms. However, state of the art mobility planning applications like open trip planner, are monolithic applications, which makes it difficult to scale and modify them dynamically. This paper describes a microservices based modular multi-modal mobility platform Mobilytics, that integrates mobility providers, commuters, and community stakeholders. We describe our requirements, architecture, and discuss the resilience challenges, and how our platform functions properly in presence of failure. Conceivably, the patterns and principles manifested in our system can serve as guidelines for current and future practitioners in this field.},

Ride-sharing platforms such as Uber and Lyft are becoming a more commonplace, particularly in urban environments. While such services may be deemed more convenient than riding public transit due to their on-demand nature, reports show that they do not necessarily decrease the congestion in major cities. One of the key problems is that typically mobility decision support systems focus on individual utility and react only after congestion appears. In this paper, we propose socially considerate multi-modal routing algorithms that are proactive and consider, via predictions, the shared effect of riders on the overall efficacy of mobility services. We have adapted the MATSim simulator framework to incorporate the proposed algorithms present a simulation analysis of a case study in Nashville, Tennessee that assesses the effects of our routing models on the traffic congestion for different levels of penetration and adoption of socially considerate routes. Our results indicate that even at a low penetration (social ratio), we are able to achieve an improvement in system-level performance.},

  abstract      = {With the advent of pervasive cloud computing technologies, service reliability and availability are becoming major concerns,especially as we start to integrate cyber-physical systems with the cloud networks. A number of smart and connected community systems such as emergency response systems utilize cloud networks to analyze real-time data streams and provide context-sensitive decision support.Improving overall system reliability requires us to study all the aspects of the end-to-end of this distributed system,including the backend data servers. In this paper, we describe a bi-layered prognostic architecture for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of components of backend servers,especially those that are subjected to degradation. We show that our architecture is especially good at predicting the remaining useful life of hard disks. A Deep LSTM Network is used as the backbone of this fast, data-driven decision framework and dynamically captures the pattern of the incoming data. In the article, we discuss the architecture of the neural network and describe the mechanisms to choose the various hyper-parameters. We describe the challenges faced in extracting effective training sets from highly unorganized and class-imbalanced big data and establish methods for online predictions with extensive data pre-processing, feature extraction and validation through test sets with unknown remaining useful lives of the hard disks. Our algorithm performs especially well in predicting RUL near the critical zone of a device approaching failure.The proposed architecture is able to predict whether a disk is going to fail in next ten days with an average precision of 0.8435.In future, we will extend this architecture to learn and predict the RUL of the edge devices in the end-to-end distributed systems of smart communities, taking into consideration context-sensitive external features such as weather.},

  abstract  = {To maintain a stable, flexible and economic operation of a microgrid, hierarchical control architecture consisting of primary, secondary and tertiary control is proposed. However, the differences in dynamics of microgrid, bandwidths of control levels and speed of communication channels make it difficult to comprehensively validate the performance of the hierarchical control schemes. In this paper we propose a hardware-in-the-loop real-time testbed for microgrid hierarchical control. The proposed testbed can be used to validate control performance under different microgrid operating modes (grid-tied or islanded), different primary control schemes (current or voltage mode) and different secondary control approaches (centralized or distributed). The integration of industry-grade hardware that runs primary and secondary control into the testbed allows for complete emulation of microgrid operation, and facilitates the study of the effects of measurement noise, sampling and communication delays.},

  abstract  = {In the next coming years, the International Space Station (ISS) plans to launch several small-sat missions powered by lithium-ion battery packs. An extended version of such mission requires dependable, energy dense, and durable power sources as well as system health monitoring. Hence a good health estimation framework to increase mission success is absolutely necessary as the devices are subjected to high demand operating conditions. This paper describes a hierarchical architecture which combines data-driven anomaly detection methods with a fine-grained model-based diagnosis and prognostics architecture. At the core of the architecture is a distributed stack of deep neural network that detects and classifies the data traces from nearby satellites based on prior observations. Any identified anomaly is transmitted to the ground, which then uses model-based diagnosis and prognosis framework to make health state estimation. In parallel, periodically the data traces from the satellites are transported to the ground and analyzed using model-based techniques. This data is then used to train the neural networks, which are run from ground systems and periodically updated. The collaborative architecture enables quick data-driven inference on the satellite and more intensive analysis on the ground where often time and power consumption are not constrained. The current work demonstrates implementation of this architecture through an initial battery data set. In the future we propose to apply this framework to other electric and electronic components on-board the small satellites.},

In this paper, a distributed control strategy is proposed for microgrid synchronization operation. The proposed controller design utilizes pinning-based consensus algorithm to avoid system single point of failure. It is able to actively track the main grid frequency, provide a good coordination between frequency and phase regulation and ensure all distributed generations in the system proportionally share the load. Implementation of such distributed algorithm in practice is difficult because it requires mitigation of both distributed computing and power system engineering challenges. In this paper, a novel software platform called RIAPS platform is presented that helps implementing the proposed distributed synchronization strategy in practical hardware controllers. The performance of the controllers are validated using a real-time controller hardware-in-the-loop microgrid testbed.},

  abstract  = {Modern manufacturing processes are increasing becoming cyber-physical in nature, where a computational system monitors the system performance, provides real-time process control by analyzing sensor data collected regarding process and product characteristics, in order to increase the quality of the manufactured product. Such real-time process monitoring and control techniques are useful in precision and ultra-precision machining processes. However, the output product quality is affected by several uncertainty sources in various stages of the manufacturing process such as the sensor uncertainty, computational system uncertainty, control input uncertainty, and the variability in the manufacturing process. The computational system may be a single computing node or a distributed computing network; the latter scenario introduces additional uncertainty due to the communication between several computing nodes. Due to the continuous monitoring process, these uncertainty sources aggregate and compound over time, resulting in variations of product quality. Therefore, characterization of the various uncertainty sources and their impact on the product quality are necessary to increase the efficiency and productivity of the overall manufacturing process. To this end, this paper develops a two-level dynamic Bayesian network methodology, where the higher level captures the uncertainty in the sensors, control inputs, and the manufacturing process while the lower level captures the uncertainty in the communication between several computing nodes. In addition, we illustrate the use of a variance-based global sensitivity analysis approach for dimension reduction in a high-dimensional manufacturing process, in order to enable real-time analysis for process control. The proposed methodologies of process control under uncertainty and dimension reduction are illustrated for a cyber-physical turning process.},

  abstract  = {The Web has empowered emergency services to enhance operations by collecting real-time information about incidents from diverse data sources such as social media. However, the high volume of unstructured data from the heterogeneous sources with varying degrees of veracity challenges the timely extraction and integration of relevant information to summarize the current situation. Existing work on event detection and summarization on social media relates to this challenge of timely extraction of information during an evolving event. However, it is limited in both integrating incomplete information from diverse sources and using the integrated information to dynamically infer knowledge representation of the situation that captures optimal actions (e.g., allocate available finite ambulances to incident regions). In this paper, we present a novel concept of an Uncertain Concept Graph (UCG) that is capable of representing dynamic knowledge of a disaster event from heterogeneous data sources, particularly for the regions of interest, and resources/services required. The information sources, incident regions, and resources (e.g., ambulances) are represented as nodes in UCG, while the edges represent the weighted relationships between these nodes. We then propose a solution for probabilistic edge inference between nodes in UCG. We model a novel optimization problem for the edge assignment between a service resource to a region node over time trajectory. The output of such structured summarization over time can be valuable for modeling event dynamics in the real world beyond emergency management, across different smart city operations such as transportation.},

These devices alter the mode of the system using locally available information in order to stop fault propagation. For example, in electrical networks relays and breakers isolate faults in order to arrest failure propagation and protect the healthy parts of the system. However, these assemblies themselves can have faults, which may inadvertently induce secondary failures. Often these secondary failures lead to cascade effects, which then lead to total system collapse. This behavior is often seen in electrical transmission systems where failures of relays and breakers may cause overloading and the disconnection of parts of an otherwise healthy system. In the past, we had developed a consistency based diagnosis approach for physical systems based on the temporal failure propagation graph. We now describe an extension that uses the concept of timed discrete event observers in combination with the timed failure propagation graphs to extend the hypothesis to include the possibility of failures in the fault protection units. Using a simulated power system case study, we show that the combined approach is able to diagnose faults in both the plant and the protection devices.},

  abstract    = {The resiliency and reliability of critical cyber physical systems like electrical power grids are of paramount importance. These systems are often equipped with specialized protection devices to detect anomalies and  isolate faults in order to arrest failure propagation and protect the healthy parts of the system.  However,  due to the limited situational awareness and hidden failures the protection devices themselves, through their operation (or mis-operation) may cause overloading and the disconnection of parts of an otherwise healthy system. This can result in cascading failures that lead to a blackout. Diagnosis of failures in such systems is extremely challenging because of the need to account  for faults in both the physical systems as well as  the protection devices, and the failure-effect propagation across the system.  
                 
                 Our approach  for diagnosing such cyber-physical systems is based on the concept of Temporal Causal Diagrams (TCD-s) that capture the  timed discrete models of protection devices and their interactions with a system failure propagation graph. In this paper we present a refinement of the TCD language with a layer of independent local observers that aid in diagnosis. We describe a hierarchical two-tier failure diagnosis approach and  showcase the results for 4 different scenarios involving both cyber and physical faults in a standard Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9 bus system.},

  abstract  = {Efficient emergency response is a major concern in densely populated urban areas. Numerous techniques have been proposed to allocate emergency responders to optimize response times, coverage, and incident prevention. Effective response depends, in turn, on effective prediction of incidents occurring in space and time, a problem which has also received considerable prior attention. We formulate a non-linear mathematical program maximizing expected incident coverage, and propose a novel algorithmic framework for solving this problem. In order to aid the optimization problem, we propose a novel incident prediction mechanism. Prior art in incident prediction does not generally consider incident priorities which are crucial in optimal dispatch, and spatial modeling either considers each discretized area independently, or learns a homogeneous model. We bridge these gaps by learning a joint distribution of both incident arrival time and severity, with spatial heterogeneity captured using a hierarchical clustering approach. Moreover, our decomposition of the joint arrival and severity distributions allows us to independently learn the continuous-time arrival model, and subsequently use a multinomial logistic regression to capture severity, conditional on incident time. We use real traffic accident and response data from the urban
               area around Nashville, USA, to evaluate the proposed approach, showing that it significantly outperforms prior art as well as the real dispatch method currently in use.},

The traffic dataset contains over 900 million data records. The network is thereafter used to classify the real-time data and identify anomalous operations. Compared with traditional approaches of using statistical or machine learning techniques, our model reaches an accuracy of 98.73 percent when identifying traffic congestion caused by football games. Our approach first encodes the traffic across a region as a scaled image. After that the image data from different timestamps is fused with event- and time-related data. Then a crossover operator is used as a data augmentation method to generate training datasets with more balanced classes. Finally, we use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to tune the sensitivity of the classifier. We present the analysis of the training time and the inference time separately.},

  abstract  = {In a smart city, real-time traffic sensors may be deployed for various applications, such as route planning. Unfortunately, sensors are prone to failures, which result in erroneous traffic data. Erroneous data can adversely affect applications such as route planning, and can cause increased travel time. To minimize the impact of sensor failures, we must detect them promptly and accurately. However, typical detection algorithms may lead to a large number of false positives (i.e., false alarms) and false negatives (i.e., missed detections), which can result in suboptimal route planning. In this paper, we devise an effective detector for identifying faulty traffic sensors using a prediction model based on Gaussian Processes. Further, we present an approach for computing the optimal parameters of the detector which minimize losses due to false-positive and false-negative errors. We also characterize critical sensors, whose failure can have high impact on the route planning application. Finally, we implement our method and evaluate it numerically using a real- world dataset and the route planning platform OpenTripPlanner.},

  abstract  = {Cascading outages in power networks cause blackouts which lead to huge economic and social consequences. The traditional form of load shedding is avoidable in many cases by identifying optimal load control actions. However, if there is a change in the system topology (adding or removing loads, lines etc), the calculations have to be performed again. This paper addresses this problem by providing a workflow that 1) generates system models from IEEE CDF specifications, 2) identifies a collection of blackout causing contingencies, 3) dynamically sets up an optimization problem, and 4) generates a table of mitigation strategies in terms of minimal load curtailment. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed methodology by finding load curtailment actions for N-k contingencies (k = 1, 2, 3) in IEEE 14 Bus system.},

However, the downside to distributing intelligence to the edge away from the controlled environment of the data centers is the increased risk of failures. The paper introduces a framework for handling these challenges. The contribution of this framework is to support strategies to (a) tolerate the transient faults as they appear due to network fluctuations or node failures, and to (b) systematically reconfigure the application if the faults persist.},

These systems consist of tightly coupled physical (energy sources, transmission and distribution lines, and loads) and computational components (protection devices, energy management systems, etc.). The protection devices such as distance relays help in preventing failure propagation by isolating faulty physical components. However, these devices rely on hard thresholds and local information, often ignoring system-level effects introduced by the distributed control algorithms. This leads to scenarios wherein a local mitigation in a subsytem could trigger a larger fault cascade, possibly resulting in a blackout.Efficient models and tools that curtail such systematic failures by performing fault diagnosis and prognosis are therefore necessary.},

  abstract  = {Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy resources and improvements in battery technology. While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a transactive microgrid, {\textquotedblleft}prosumers{\textquotedblright} (i.e., consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system. On the one hand, prosumers{\textquoteright} personal information must be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. This paper describes Privacypreserving Energy Transactions (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading.},

In this paper, we briefly describe a component-based decentralized software platform called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Systems (RIAPS) which provides an infrastructure for such systems. We briefly describe some initial applications built using this platform. Then, we focus on the design and integration choices for a resilient Discovery Manager service that is a critical component of this infrastructure. The service allows applications to discover each other, work collaboratively, and ensure the stability of the Smart System.},

Distributed ledgers have recently found widespread interest in this domain due to their ability to provide transactional integrity across decentralized computing nodes. However, the existing state of the art has not focused on the privacy preservation requirement of these energy systems -- the transaction level data can provide much greater insights into a prosumer's behavior compared to smart meter data. There are specific safety requirements in transactive microgrids to ensure the stability of the grid and to control the load. To fulfil these requirements, the distribution system operator needs transaction information from the grid, which poses a further challenge to the privacy-goals. This problem is made worse by requirement for off-blockchain communication in these networks. In this paper, we extend a recently developed trading workflow called PETra and describe our solution for communication and transactional anonymity.},

  abstract  = {Data generated by GPS-equipped probe vehicles, especially public transit vehicles can be a reliable source for traffic speed estimation. Traditionally, this estimation is done by learning the parameters of a model that describes the relationship between the speed of the probe vehicle and the actual traffic speed. However, such approaches typically suffer from data sparsity issues. Furthermore, most state of the art approaches does not consider the effect of weather and the driver of the probe vehicle on the parameters of the learned model. In this paper, we describe a multivariate predictive multi-model approach called SpeedPro that (a) first identifies similar clusters of operation from the historic data that includes the real-time position of the probe vehicle, the weather data, and anonymized driver identifier, and then (b) uses these different models to estimate the traffic speed in real-time as a function of current weather, driver and probe vehicle speed. When the real-time information is not available our approach uses a different model that uses the historical weather and traffic information for estimation. Our results show that the purely historical data is less accurate than the model that uses the real-time information.},

However, it is a non-trivial task for transit agencies to adjust the existing bus schedule to optimize the on-time performance for the future. For example, severe weather conditions and special events in the city could slow down traffic and cause bus delay. Furthermore, the delay of previous trips may affect the initial departure time of consecutive trips and generate accumulated delay. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a single-objective optimization task with constraints and propose a greedy algorithm and a genetic algorithm to generate bus schedules at timepoints that improve the bus on-time performance at timepoints which is indicated by whether the arrival delay is within the desired range. We use the Nashville bus system as a case study and simulate the optimization performance using historical data. The comparative analysis of the results identifies that delay patterns change over time and reveals the efficiency of the greedy and genetic algorithms.},

  abstract  = {This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.},

  abstract  = {Advances in data collection and storage infrastructure offer an unprecedented opportunity to integrate both data and emergency resources in a city into a dynamic learning system that can anticipate and rapidly respond to heterogeneous incidents. In this paper, we describe integration methods for spatio-temporal incident forecasting using previously collected vehicular accident data provided to us by the Nashville Fire Department. The literature provides several techniques that focus on analyzing features and predicting accidents for specific situations (specific intersections in a city, or certain segments of a freeway, for example), but these models break down when applied to a large, general area consisting of many road and intersection types and other factors like weather conditions. We use Similarity Based Agglomerative Clustering (SBAC) analysis to categorize incidents to account for these variables. Thereafter, we use survival analysis to learn the likelihood of incidents per cluster. The mapping of the clusters to the spatial locations is achieved using a Bayesian network. The prediction methods we have developed lay the foundation for future work on an optimal emergency vehicle allocation and dispatch system in Nashville.},

  abstract  = {Formation of microgrids have been proposed as a solution to improve grid reliability, and enable smoother integration of renewables into the grid. Microgrids are sections of the grid that can operate in isolation from the main power system. Maintaining power balance within an islanded microgrid is a challenging task, due to the low system inertia, which requires complex control to maintain stable and optimized operation. Many studies have demonstrated feasible distributed microgrid controllers that can maintain microgrid stability in grid connected and islanded modes. However, there is little emphasis on how to implement these distributed algorithms on a computational platform that allows for fast and seamless deployment. This paper introduces a decentralized software platform called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Systems (RIAPS) that runs on processors embedded with the microgrid component. As an example, we describe the implementation of a distributed microgrid secondary control and resynchronization algorithms on RIAPS platform. The controller developed on RIAPS platform is validated on a real-time microgrid testbed.},

  abstract  = {Cascading failures in electrical power systems are one of the major causes of concern for the modem society as it results in huge socio-economic loss. Tools for analyzing these failures while considering different aspects of the system are typically very expensive. Thus, researchers tend to use multiple tools to perform various types of analysis on the same system model in order to understand the reasons for these failures in detail. Modeling a simple system in multiple platforms is a tedious, error prone and time consuming process. This paper describes a domain specific modeling language (DSML) for power systems. It identifies and captures the right abstractions for modeling components in different analysis tools. A framework is proposed that deals with system modeling using the developed DSML, identifying the type of analysis to be performed, choosing the appropriate tool(s) needed for the analysis from the tool-chain, transforming the model based on the required specifications of a particular tool and performing the analysis. A case study is done on WSCC-9 Bus System, IEEE-14 Bus System and IEEE-39 Bus System to demonstrate the entire workflow of the framework in identifying critical components for power systems.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as energy consumption is essential for decision-making during the design and operation of smart manufacturing systems. The measurements of KPIs are strongly affected by several uncertainty sources such as input material uncertainty, the inherent variability in the manufacturing process, model uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the sensor measurements of operational data. A comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty sources and their effect on the KPIs is required to make the manufacturing processes more efficient. Towards this objective, this paper proposed an automated methodology to generate a hierarchical Bayesian network (HBN) for a manufacturing system from semantic system models, physics-based models, and available data in an automated manner, which can be used to perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis. The semantic system model, which is a high-level model describing the system along with its parameters, is assumed to be available in the generic modeling environment (GME) platform. Apart from semantic description, physics-based models, if available, are assumed to be available in model libraries. The proposed methodology was divided into two tasks: (1) automated hierarchical Bayesian network construction using the semantic system model, available models and data, and (2) automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis. A metamodel of an HBN was developed using the GME, along with a syntax representation for the associated conditional probability tables/distributions. The constructed HBN corresponding to a system was represented as an instance model of the HBN metamodel. On the metamodel, a model interpreter was written to be able to carry out the UQ analysis in an automated manner for any HBN instance model conforming to the HBN metamodel. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated using an injection molding process.},

Computation and communication resources, sensors, and actuators that are shared among different applications characterize these systems. The cyber-physical nature of these systems means that physical environments can affect both the resource availability and software applications that depend on resource availability. While many application development and management challenges associated with such systems have been described in existing literature, resilient operation and execution have received less attention. This paper describes our work on improving runtime support for resilience in mobile CPS, with a special focus on our runtime infrastructure that provides autonomous resilience via self-reconfiguration. We also describe the interplay between this runtime infrastructure and our design-time tools, as the later is used to statically determine the resilience properties of the former. Finally, we present a use case study to demonstrate and evaluate our design-time resilience analysis and runtime self-reconfiguration infrastructure.},

  abstract  = {In modern networked control applications, confidentiality and integrity are important features to address in order to prevent against attacks. Moreover, network control systems are a fundamental part of the communication components of current cyber-physical systems (e.g., automotive communications). Many networked control systems employ Time-Triggered (TT) architectures that provide mechanisms enabling the exchange of precise and synchronous messages. TT systems have computation and communication constraints, and with the aim to enable secure communications in the network, it is important to evaluate the computational and communication overhead of implementing secure communication mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the effects of adding a Hash-based Message Authentication (HMAC) to TT networked control systems. The contributions of the paper include (1) the analysis and experimental validation of the communication overhead, as well as a scalability analysis that utilizes the experimental result for both wired and wireless platforms and (2) an experimental evaluation of the computational overhead of HMAC based on a kernel-level Linux implementation. An automotive application is used as an example, and the results show that it is feasible to implement a secure communication mechanism without interfering with the existing automotive controller execution times. The methods and results of the paper can be used for evaluating the performance impact of security mechanisms and, thus, for the design of secure wired and wireless TT networked control systems.},

  abstract  = {Effective public transit operations are one of the fundamental requirements for a modern community. Recently, a number of transit agencies have started integrating automated vehicle locators in their fleet, which provides a real-time estimate of the time of arrival. In this paper, we use the data collected over several months from one such transit system and show how this data can be potentially used to learn long term patterns of travel time. More specifically, we study the effect of weather and other factors such as traffic on the transit system delay. These models can later be used to understand the seasonal variations and to design adaptive and transient transit schedules. Towards this goal, we also propose an online architecture called DelayRadar. The novelty of DelayRadar lies in three aspects: (1) a data store that collects and integrates real-time and static data from multiple data sources, (2) a predictive statistical model that analyzes the data to make predictions on transit travel time, and (3) a decision making framework to develop an optimal transit schedule based on variable forecasts related to traffic, weather, and other impactful factors. This paper focuses on identifying the model with the best predictive accuracy to be used in DelayRadar. According to the preliminary study results, we are able to explain more than 70\% of the variance in the bus travel time and we can make future travel predictions with an out-of-sample error of 4.8 minutes with information on the bus schedule, traffic, and weather.},

However, the decision of these protection elements is only influenced by local information in the form of bus voltage/current (V-I) samples. Due to lack of system wide perspective, erroneous settings, and latent failure modes, protection devices often mis-operate and cause cascading effects that ultimately lead to blackouts. Blackouts around the world have been triggered or worsened by circuit breakers tripping, including the blackout of 2003 in North America, where the secondary/ remote protection relays incorrectly opened the breaker. Tools that aid the operators in finding the root cause of the problem on-line are required. However, high system complexity and the interdependencies between the cyber and physical elements of the system and the mis-operation of protection devices make the failure diagnosis a challenging problem.},

This pressure is motivating the integration of digital technology and advanced power-industry practices to improve the management of distributed electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, thereby creating a web of systems. Unlike legacy power system infrastructure, however, this emerging next-generation smart grid should be context-aware and adaptive to enable the creation of applications needed to enhance grid robustness and efficiency. This paper describes key factors that are driving the architecture of smart grids and describes orchestration middleware needed to make the infrastructure resilient. We use an example of adaptive protection logic in smart grid substations as a use case to motivate the need for contextawareness and adaptivity.},

The distributed and remote nature of these systems often necessitates the use of Deployment and Configuration (D&C) services to manage the lifecycle of these applications. Fluctuating resources, volatile cluster membership and changing environmental conditions necessitate resilience. Thus, the D&C infrastructure does not only have to undertake basic management actions, such as activation of new applications and deactivation of existing applications, but also has to autonomously reconfigure existing applications to mitigate failures including D&C infrastructure failures. This paper describes the design and architectural considerations to realize such a D&C infrastructure for component-based distributed systems. Experimental results demonstrating the autonomous resilience capabilities are presented.},

  abstract  = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems with a tight integration between the computational (also referred to as software or cyber) and physical (hardware) components. While the reliability evaluation of physical systems is well-understood and well-studied, reliability evaluation of CPS is difficult because software systems do not degrade and follow a well-defined failure model like physical systems. In this paper, we propose a framework for formulating the CPS reliability evaluation as a dependence problem derived from the software component dependences, functional requirements and physical system dependences. We also consider sensor failures, and propose a method for estimating software failures in terms of associated hardware and software inputs. This framework is codified in a domain-specific modeling language, where every system-level function is mapped to a set of required components using functional decomposition and function-component association; this provides details about operational constraints and dependences. We also illustrate how the encoded information can be used to make reconfiguration decisions at runtime. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a smart parking system, which provides localization and guidance for parking within indoor environments.},

  abstract  = {Public bus transit plays an important role in city transportation infrastructure. However, public bus transit is often difficult to use because of lack of real- time information about bus locations and delay time, which in the presence of operational delays and service alerts makes it difficult for riders to predict when buses will arrive and plan trips. Precisely tracking vehicle and informing riders of estimated times of arrival is challenging due to a number of factors, such as traffic congestion, operational delays, varying times taken to load passengers at each stop. In this paper, we introduce a public transportation decision support system for both short-term as well as long-term prediction of arrival bus times. The system uses streaming real-time bus position data, which is updated once every minute, and historical arrival and departure data - available for select stops to predict bus arrival times. Our approach combines clustering analysis and Kalman filters with a shared route segment model in order to produce more accurate arrival time predictions. Experiments show that compared to the basic arrival time prediction model that is currently being used by the city, our system reduces arrival time prediction errors by 25 percent on average when predicting the arrival delay an hour ahead and 47 percent when predicting within a 15 minute future time window.},

  abstract  = {Rapid evolution of energy generation technology and increased used of distributed energy resources (DER) is continually pushing utilities to adapt and evolve business models to align with these changes. Today, more consumers are also producing energy using green generation technologies and energy pricing is becoming rather competitive and transactional, needing utilities to increase flexibility of grid operations and incorporate transactive energy systems (TES). However, a huge bottleneck is to ensure stable grid operations while gaining efficiency. A comprehensive platform is therefore needed for grid-scale multi-aspects integrated evaluations. For instance, cyber-attacks in a road traffic controller{\textquoteright}s communication network can subtly divert electric vehicles in a particular area, causing surge in the grid loads due to increased EV charging and people activity, which can potentially disrupt, an otherwise robust, grid. To evaluate such a scenario, multiple special-purpose simulators (e.g., SUMO, OMNeT++, GridlabD, etc.) must be run in an integrated manner. To support this, we are developing a cloud-deployed web- and model-based simulation integration platform that enables integrated evaluations of transactive energy systems and is highly extensible and customizable for utility-specific custom simulation tools.},

These platforms illustrate high degree of heterogeneity. In this paper, we focus on software heterogeneity arising from different types of applications. The source of variability among applications stems from (a) timing requirements, (b) rate and volume of data they interact with, and (c) behavior depending on whether they are stateful or stateless. These variations result in applications with different computation models. However, a smart city system can comprise multi-domain applications with different types and therefore computation models. As such, a key challenge that arises is that of integration; we require some mechanism to facilitate integration and interaction between applications that use different computation models. In this paper, we first identify computation models based on different application types. Second, we present a generic computation model and explain how it can map to previously identified computation models. Finally, we briefly describe how the generic computation model fits in our overall smart city platform architecture.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a framework for the extraction of a reliability block diagram in component-based systems for reliability prediction with respect to specific missions. A mission is defined as a composition of several high-level functions occurring at different stages and for a specific time during the mission. The high-level functions are decomposed into lower-level functions, which are then mapped to their corresponding components or component assemblies. The reliability block diagram is obtained using functional decomposition and function-component association. Using the reliability block diagram and the reliability information on the components such as failure rates, the reliability of the system carrying out a mission can be estimated. The reliability block diagram is evaluated by converting it into a logic (Boolean) expression. A modeling language created using the Generic Modeling Environment (GME) platform is used, which enables modeling of a system and captures the functional decomposition and function-component association in the system. This framework also allows for real-time monitoring of the system performance where the reliability of the mission can be computed over time as the mission progresses. The uncertainties in the failure rates and operational time of each high-level function are also considered which are quantified through probability distributions using the Bayesian framework. The dependence between failures of components are also considered and are quantified through a Bayesian network (BN). Other quantities of interest such as mission feasibility and function availability can also be assessed using this framework. Mission feasibility analysis determines if the mission can be accomplished given the current state of components in the system, and function availability provides information whether the function will be available in the future given the current state of the system. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a radio-controlled (RC) car to carry out a simple surveillance mission.},

The idea is to first apply unsupervised learning methods to the telemetry data divided into temporal segments. The large clusters that ensue typically represent the nominal operations of the spacecraft and are not of interest from an anomaly detection viewpoint. However, the smaller clusters and outliers that result from this analysis may represent specialized modes of operation, e.g., conduct of a specialized experiment on board the spacecraft, or they may represent true anomalous or unexpected behaviors. To differentiate between specialized modes and anomalies, we employ a supervised method of consulting human mission experts in the approach presented in this paper. Our longer term goal is to develop more automated methods for detecting anomalies in time series data, and once
               anomalies are identified, use feature selection methods to build online detectors that can be used in future missions, thus contributing to making operations more effective and improving overall safety of the mission.},

While technology exists today for engineering distributed, real-time component-based applications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools. Model-driven development techniques are powerful, but there are very few existing and complete tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution to developers, from design to deployment. There is a need for an integrated model-driven development environment that addresses all phases of application lifecycle including design, development, verification, analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, with supporting automation in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such a model-driven environment is the modeling language. To that end, this paper presents a wide-spectrum architecture design language called DREMS ML that itself is an integrated collection of individual domain-specific sub-languages. We claim that the language promotes {\textquotedblleft}correct-by-construction{\textquotedblright} software development and integration by supporting each individual phase of the application lifecycle. Using a case study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS ML impacts the development of embedded systems.},

Fractionated spacecraft, smart cities computing architectures, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clusters, platoon of vehicles on highways are all examples of extensible CPS wherein extensibility is implied by the dynamic aggregation of physical resources, affect of physical dynamics on availability of computing resources, and various multi-domain applications hosted on these systems. However, realization of extensible CPS requires resolving design-time and run-time challenges emanating from properties specific to these systems. In this paper, we first describe different properties of extensible CPS - dynamism, extensibility, remote deployment, security, heterogeneity and resilience. Then we identify different design-time challenges stemming from heterogeneity and resilience requirements. We particularly focus on software heterogeneity arising from availability of various communication middleware. We then present appropriate solutions in the context of a novel domain specific language, which can be used to design resilient systems while remaining agnostic to middleware heterogeneities. We also describe how this language and its features have evolved from our past work. We use a platform of fractionated spacecraft to describe our solution.},

  abstract  = {Due to increasing design complexity, modern systems are modeled at a high level of abstraction. SystemC is widely accepted as a system level language for modeling complex embedded systems. Verification of these SystemC designs nullifies the chances of error propagation down to the hardware. Due to lack of formal semantics of SystemC, the verification of such designs is done mostly in an unsystematic manner. This paper provides a new modeling environment that enables the designer to simulate and formally verify the designs by generating SystemC code. The generated SystemC code is automatically translated to timed automata for formal analysis.},

  abstract    = {Next generation large-scale distributed systems {\textendash} such as smart cities {\textendash} are dynamic, heterogeneous and multi-domain in nature. The same is true for applications hosted on these systems. Application heterogeneity stems from their Unit of Composition (UoC); some applications might be coarse-grained and composed from processes or actors, whereas others might be fine-grained and composed from software components. Software components can further amplify heterogeneity since there exists different component models for different domains. Lifecycle management of such distributed, heterogeneous applications is a considerable challenge.
                 
                 In this paper, we solve this problem by reasoning about these systems as a Software Product Line (SPL) where individual dimensions of heterogeneity can be considered as product variants. To enable such reasoning, first, we present UMRELA (Universal feature-Model for distRibutEd appLicAtions), a conceptual feature model that identifies commonalities and variability points for capturing and representing distributed applications and their target system. This results in a product line of a family of distributed applications. UMRELA facilitates representation of initial configuration point, and the configuration space of the system. The latter represents all possible states the system can reach and is used as an implicit encoding to calculate new configuration points at runtime. Second, we present a prototype Application Management Framework (AMF) as a proof of concept configuration management tool that uses UMRELA to manage heterogeneous distributed applications.},

Factors such as interference or node mobility cause such wireless networks to experience changes in both topology and link capacities. These dynamic networks pose a reliability concern for high-criticality or mixed-criticality systems which require strict guarantees about system performance and robustness prior to deployment. To address the design- and run-time verification and reliability concerns created by these dynamic networks, we are developing an integrated modeling, analysis, and run-time toolsuite which provides (1) network profiles that model the dynamics of system network resources and application network requirements over time, (2) design-time verification of application performance on dynamic networks, and (3) management of the CPS network resources during run-time. In this paper we present the foundations for the analysis of dynamic networks and show experimental validations of this analysis.

  abstract  = {Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on distributed computing platforms where sensing, computing, actuation, and communication resources are shared by a multitude of applications. Such 'cyber-physical cloud computing platforms' present novel challenges because the system is built from mobile embedded devices, is inherently distributed, and typically suffers from highly fluctuating connectivity among the modules. Architecting software for these systems raises many challenges not present in traditional cloud computing. Effective management of constrained resources and application isolation without adversely affecting performance are necessary. Autonomous fault management and real-time performance requirements must be met in a verifiable manner. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The component model facilitates the construction of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a domain-specific modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation.},

Complex, integrated systems like managed satellite clusters expose heterogeneous concerns such as strict timing requirements, complexity in system integration, deployment, and repair; and resilience to faults. Integrating appropriate modeling and analysis techniques into the design of such systems helps ensure predictable, dependable and safe operation upon deployment. This paper describes how we can model and analyze applications for these systems in order to verify system properties such as lack of deadline violations. Our approach is based on (1) formalizing the component operation scheduling using Colored Petri nets (CPN), (2) modeling the abstract temporal behavior of application components, and (3) integrating the business logic and the component operation scheduling models into a concrete CPN, which is then analyzed. This model-driven approach enables a verication-driven workow wherein the application model can be rened and restructured

This paper describes a rapid development and testing framework for a distributed satellite system.

Due to their critical nature, these systems are equipped with fast-acting, local protection mechanisms. However, commonly misguided protection actions together with system dynamics can lead to un-intentional cascading effects. This paper describes the ongoing work using Temporal Causal Diagrams (TCD), a refinement of the Timed Failure Propagation Graphs (TFPG), to diagnose problems associated with the power transmission lines protected by a combination of relays and breakers. The TCD models represent the faults and their propagation as TFPG, the nominal and faulty behavior of components (including local, discrete controllers and protection devices) as Timed Discrete Event Systems (TDES), and capture the cumulative and cascading effects of these interactions. The TCD diagnosis engine includes an extended TFPG-like reasoner which in addition to observing the alarms and mode changes (as the TFPG), monitors the event traces (that correspond to the behavioral aspects of the model) to generate hypotheses that consistently explain all the observations. In this paper, we show the results of applying the TCD to a segment of a power transmission system that is protected by distance relays and breakers.},

Since applications with different security classification levels must be supported in these open systems, the system must provide strict information partitioning such that only applications with matching security classifications interact with each other. The anonymous publish/subscribe communication pattern is a powerful interaction abstraction that has enjoyed great success in previous space software architectures, such as NASA's Core Flight Executive. However, the difficulty is that existing solutions that support anonymous publish/subscribe communication, such as the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS), do not support information partitioning based on security classifications, which is a key requirement for some systems. This paper makes two contributions to address these limitations. First, we present a transport mechanism called Secure Transport that uses a lattice of labels to represent security classifications and enforces Multi-Level Security (MLS) policies to ensure strict information partitioning. Second, we present a novel discovery service that allows us to use an existing DDS implementation with our custom transport mechanism to realize a publish/subscribe middleware with information partitioning based on security classifications of applications. We also include an evaluation of our solution in the context of a use case scenario.},

These systems are dynamic and reconfigurable, and provide a {\textquotedblleft}CPS cluster-as-a-service{\textquotedblright} for mission-specific scientific applications that can benefit from the elasticity of the cluster membership and heterogeneity of the cluster members. The distributed and remote nature of these systems often necessitates the use of Deployment and Configuration (D&C) services to manage the lifecycle of software applications. Fluctuating resources, volatile cluster membership and changing environmental conditions require resilient D&C services. However, the dynamic nature of the system often precludes human intervention during the D&C activities, which motivates the need for a self-adaptive D&C infrastructure that supports autonomous resilience. Such an infrastructure must have the ability to adapt existing applications on-the-fly in order to provide application resilience and must itself be able to adapt to account for changes in the system as well as tolerate failures. This paper makes two contributions towards addressing these needed. First, we identify the key challenges in achieving such a self-adaptive D&C infrastructure. Second, we present our ideas on resolving these challenges and realizing a self-adaptive D&C infrastructure.},

This system in space is a cloud platform that facilitates sharing sensors and other computing and communication resources across multiple applications, potentially developed and maintained by different organizations. Effectively, such architecture can realize the functions of monolithic satellites at a reduced cost and with improved adaptivity and robustness. Openness of these architectures pose special challenges because the distributed software platform has to support applications from different security domains and organizations, and where information flows have to be carefully managed and compartmentalized. If the platform is used as a robust shared resource its management, configuration, and resilience becomes a challenge in itself. We have designed and prototyped a distributed software platform for such architectures. The core element of the platform is a new operating system whose services were designed to restrict access to the network and the file system, and to enforce resource management constraints for all non-privileged processes Mixed-criticality applications operating at different security labels are deployed and controlled by a privileged management process that is also pre-configuring all information flows.

A mission comprises of different timed mission stages, with each stage requiring a number of highlevel functions. The work presented here describes a modeling language to capture the functional decomposition and missions of a system. The components and their alternatives are mapped to basic functions which are used to implement the system-level functions. Our contribution is the extraction of mission-specific reliability block diagram from these high-level models of component assemblies. This is then used to compute the mission reliability using reliability information of components. This framework can be used for real-time monitoring of system performance where reliability of the mission is computed over time as the mission is in progress. Other quantities of interest such as mission feasibility, function availability can also be computed using this framework. Mission feasibility answers the question whether the mission can be accomplished given the current
               state of components in the system and function availability provides information if the function is available in the future given the current state of the system. The software used in this framework includes Generic Modeling Environment (GME) and Python. GME is used for modeling the system and Python for reliability computations. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a radio-controlled (RC) car in carrying out a simple surveillance mission.},

  abstract    = {Multi-module Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), such as satellite clusters, swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and fleets of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) are examples of managed distributed real-time systems where mission-critical applications, such as sensor fusion or coordinated flight control, are hosted. These systems are dynamic and reconfigurable, and provide a "CPS cluster-as-a-service{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} for mission-specific scientific applications that can benefit from the elasticity of the cluster membership and heterogeneity of the cluster members. Distributed and remote nature of these systems often necessitates the use of Deployment and Configuration (D\&C) services to manage lifecycle of software applications. Fluctuating resources, volatile cluster membership and changing environmental conditions require resilience. However, due to the dynamic nature of the system, human intervention is often infeasible. This necessitates a self-adaptive D\&C infrastructure that supports autonomous resilience. Such an infrastructure must have the ability to adapt existing applications on the fly in order to provide application resilience and must itself be able to adapt to account for changes in the system as well as tolerate failures. 
                 
                 This paper describes the design and architectural considerations to realize a self-adaptive, D\&C infrastructure for CPSs. Previous efforts in this area have resulted in D\&C infrastructures that support application adaptation via dynamic re-deployment and re-configuration mechanisms. Our work, presented in this paper, improves upon these past efforts by implementing a self-adaptive D\&C infrastructure which itself is resilient. The paper concludes with experimental results that demonstrate the autonomous resilience capabilities of our new D\&C infrastructure.},

  abstract  = {Rising software complexity in aerospace systems makes them very difficult to analyze and prepare for all possible fault scenarios at design time; therefore, classical run-time fault tolerance techniques such as self-checking pairs and triple modular redundancy are used. However, several recent incidents have made it clear that existing software fault tolerance techniques alone are not sufficient. To improve system dependability, simpler, yet formally specified and verified run-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault mitigation capabilities are needed. Such architectures are already in use for managing the health of vehicles and systems. Software health management is the application of these techniques to software systems. In this paper, we briefly describe the software health management techniques and architecture developed by our research group. The foundation of the architecture is a real-time component framework (built upon ARINC-653 platform services) that defines a model of computation for software components. Dedicated architectural elements: the Component Level Health Manager (CLHM) and System Level Health Manager (SLHM) provide the health management services: anomaly detection, fault source isolation, and fault mitigation. The SLHM includes a diagnosis engine that (1) uses a Timed Failure Propagation Graph (TFPG) model derived from the component assembly model, (2) reasons about cascading fault effects in the system, and (3) isolates the fault source component(s). Thereafter, the appropriate system-level mitigation action is taken. The main focus of this article is the description of the fault mitigation architecture that uses goal-based deliberative reasoning to determine the best mitigation actions for recovering the system from the identified failure mode.},

  abstract  = {Fractionated spacecraft are clusters of small, independent modules that interact wirelessly to realize the functionality of a traditional monolithic spacecraft. System F6 (F6 stands for Future, Fast, Flexible, Fractionated, Free-Flying spacecraft) is a DARPA program for fractionated spacecraft. Software applications in F6 are implemented in the context of the F6 Information Architecture Platform (IAP), which provides component-based abstractions for composing distributed applications. The lifecycle of these distributed applications must be managed autonomously by a deployment and configuration (D\&C) infrastructure, which can redeploy and reconfigure the running applications in response to faults and other anomalies that may occur during system operation. Addressing these D\&C requirements is hard due to the significant fluctuation in resource availabilities, constraints on resources, and safety and security concerns. This paper presents the key architectural ideas that are required in realizing such a D\&C infrastructure.},

  abstract  = {Component-based programming models are well-suited to the design of large-scale, distributed applications because of the ease with which distributed functionality can be developed, deployed, and validated using the models' compositional properties. Existing component models supported by standardized technologies, such as the OMG's CORBA Component Model (CCM), however, incur a number of limitations in the context of cyber physical systems (CPS) that operate in highly dynamic, resource-constrained, and uncertain environments, such as space environments, yet require multiple quality of service (QoS) assurances, such as timeliness, reliability, and security. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents the design of a novel component model called F6COM that is developed for applications operating in the context of a cluster of fractionated spacecraft. Although F6COM leverages the compositional capabilities and port abstractions of existing component models, it provides several new features. Specifically, F6COM abstracts the component operations as tasks, which are scheduled sequentially based on a specified scheduling policy. The infrastructure ensures that at any time at most one task of a component can be active - eliminating race conditions and deadlocks without requiring complicated and error-prone synchronization logic to be written by the component developer. These tasks can be initiated due to (a) interactions with other components, (b) expiration of timers, both sporadic and periodic, and (c) interactions with input/output devices. Interactions with other components are facilitated by ports. To ensure secure information flows, every port of an F6COM component is associated with a security label such that all interactions are executed within a security context. Thus, all component interactions can be subjected to Mandatory Access Control checks by a Trusted Computing Base that facilitates the interactions. Finally, F6COM provides capabilities to monitor task execution deadlines and to configure component-specific fault mitigation actions.},

  abstract     = {Fractionated spacecraft is a novel space architecture that uses a cluster of small spacecraft modules (with their own attitude control and propulsion systems) connected via wireless links to accomplish complex missions. Resources, such as sensors, persistent storage space, processing power, and downlink bandwidth can be shared among the members of the cluster thanks to the networking. Such spacecraft can serve as a cost effective, highly adaptable, and fault tolerant platform for running various distributed mission software applications that collect, process, and downlink data. Naturally, a key component in such a system is the software platform: the
                  distributed operating system and software infrastructure that makes such applications possible. Existing operating systems are insufficient, and newer technologies like component frameworks do not address all the requirements of such flexible space architectures. The high degree of flexibility and the need for thorough planning and analysis of the resource management necessitates the use of advanced development techniques. This paper describes the core principles and design of a software component framework for fractionated spacecraft that is a special case of a distributed real-time embedded system. Additionally we describe how a model-driven development
                  environment helps with the design and engineering of complex applications for this platform. },

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a novel modeling and simulation environment for ship design based on the principles of Model Integrated Computing (MIC). The proposed approach facilitates the design and analysis of shipboard power systems and similar systems that integrate components from different fields of expertise. The conventional simulation platforms such as Matlab{\textregistered}, Simulink{\textregistered}, PSCAD{\textregistered} and VTB{\textregistered} require the designers to have explicit knowledge of the syntactic and semantic information of the desired domain within the tools. This constraint, however, severely slows down the design and analysis process, and causes cross-domain or cross-platform operations remain error prone and expensive. Our approach focuses on the development of a modeling environment that provides generic support for a variety of application across different domains by capturing modeling concepts, composition principles and operation constraints. For the preliminary demonstration of the modeling concept, in this paper we limit the scope of design to cross-platform implementations of the proposed environment by developing an application model of a simplified shipboard power system and using Matlab engine and VTB solver separately to evaluate the performance with different respects. In the case studies a fault scenario is pre-specified and tested on the system model. The corresponding time domain bus voltage magnitude and angle profiles are generated via invoking external solver, displayed to users and then saved for future analysis.},

  abstract  = {Distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems are a class of real-time systems formed through a composition of predominantly legacy, closed and statically scheduled real-time subsystems, which comprise over-provisioned resources to deal with worst-case failure scenarios. The formation of the system-of-systems leads to a new range of faults that manifest at different granularities for which no statically defined fault tolerance scheme applies. Thus, dynamic and adaptive fault tolerance mechanisms are needed which must execute within the available resources without compromising the safety and timeliness of existing real-time tasks in the individual subsystems. To address these requirements, this paper describes a middleware solution called Safe Middleware Adaptation for Real-Time Fault Tolerance (SafeMAT), which opportunistically leverages the available slack in the over-provisioned resources of individual subsystems. SafeMAT comprises three primary artifacts: (1) a flexible and configurable distributed, runtime resource monitoring framework that can pinpoint in real-time the available slack in the system that is used in making dynamic and adaptive fault tolerance decisions, (2) a safe and resource aware dynamic failure adaptation algorithm that enables efficient recovery from different granularities of failures within the available slack in the execution schedule while ensuring real-time constraints are not violated and resources are not overloaded, and (3) a framework that empirically validates the correctness of the dynamic mechanisms and the safety of the DRE system. Experimental results evaluating SafeMAT on an avionics application indicates that SafeMAT incurs only 9-15\% runtime fail over and 2-6\% processor utilization overheads thereby providing safe and predictable failure adaptability in real-time.},

  abstract  = {Data centers and computing service providers are striving to improve the utilization of their computing resources. This is primarily due to the need of resources to be more economical and power efficient. Virtualization is one of the concepts that provide flexibility to host multiple operating system stacks on a single hardware. By effectively partitioning the computing resources, it reduces the total number of physical servers and consolidates several services on a single physical rack. Each virtual machine behaves like an independent machine (may be duplicate of the original one) while the scheduling of hardware resources among different virtual machines is performed with the help of a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). Proliferation of virtual machines in the enterprise architecture creates need for identification of potential security risks as well as appropriate solutions for the identified risks to ensure the integrity of the underlying applications hosted at the virtual machines. This paper describes available virtualization technologies, corresponding security vulnerabilities, and available solutions.},

  abstract  = {A fractionated spacecraft is a cluster of independent modules that interact wirelessly to maintain cluster flight and realize the functions usually performed by a monolithic satellite. This spacecraft architecture poses novel software challenges because the hardware platform is inherently distributed, with highly fluctuating connectivity among the modules. It is critical for mission success to support autonomous fault management and to satisfy real-time performance requirements. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple organizations and users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution proposed in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The operating system provides primitives for concurrency, synchronization, and secure information flows; it also enforces application separation and resource management policies. The middleware provides higher-level services supporting request/response and publish/subscribe interactions for distributed software. The component model facilitates the creation of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. Two cross-cutting aspects - multi-level security and multi-layered fault management - are addressed at all levels of the architecture. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a dedicated modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation.},

  abstract  = {One of the main requirements for building an autonomic system is to have a robust monitoring framework. In this paper, a systematic distributed event based (DEB) system monitoring framework {\textquotedblleft}RFDMon{\textquotedblright} is presented for measuring system variables (CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk utilization, network utilization, etc.), system health (temperature and voltage of Motherboard and CPU) application performance variables (application response time, queue size, and throughput), and scientific application data structures (PBS information and MPI variables) accurately with minimum latency at a specified rate and with controllable resource utilization. This framework is designed to be tolerant to faults in monitoring framework, self-configuring (can start and stop monitoring the nodes and configure monitors for threshold values/changes for publishing the measurements), aware of execution of the framework on multiple nodes through HEARTBEAT messages, extensive (monitors multiple parameters through periodic and aperiodic sensors), resource constrainable (computational resources can be limited for monitors), and expandable for adding extra monitors on the fly. Since RFDMon uses a Data Distribution Services (DDS) middleware, it can be used for deploying in systems with heterogeneous nodes. Additionally, it provides a functionality to limit the maximum cap on resources consumed by monitoring processes such that it reduces the effect on the availability of resources for the applications.},

Such a model defines what a component is, how it works, and how it interacts with other components. It is especially important for real-time systems to have such a component model, as many problems in these systems arise from poorly understood and analyzed component interactions. In this paper we describe a component model for hard real-time systems that relies on the services of an ARINC-653 compliant real-time operating system platform. The model provides high-level abstractions of component interactions, both for the synchronous and asynchronous case. We present a formalization of the component model in the form of timed transition traces. Such formalization is necessary to be able  to derive interesting system level properties such as fault propagation graphs from models of component assemblies. We provide a brief discussion about such system level fault propagation templates  for this component model.},

One technology that can be used to mitigate this complexity is component-based software development. However, in spite of the apparent benefits of a component-based approach to development, little work has been done in applying these concepts to hard real time systems. This paper improves the state of the art by making three contributions: (1) we present a component model for hard real time systems and define the semantics of different types of component interactions; (2) we present an implementation of a middleware that supports this component model. This middleware combines an open source CORBA Component Model (CCM) implementation (MICO) with ARINC-653: a state of the art RTOS standard, (3) finally; we describe a modeling environment that enables design, analysis, and deployment of component assemblies. We conclude with a discussion of lessons learned during this exercise. Our experiences point towards extending both the CCM as well as revising the ARINC-653.},

In the context of Cloud computing, auto scaling mechanisms hold the promise of assuring QoS properties to the applications while simultaneously making efficient use of resources and keeping operational costs low for the service providers. Despite the perceived advantages of auto scaling, realizing the full potential of auto scaling is hard due to multiple challenges stemming from the need to precisely estimate resource usage in the face of significant variability in client workload patterns. This paper makes three contributions to overcome the general lack of effective techniques for workload forecasting and optimal resource allocation. First, it discusses the challenges involved in auto scaling in the cloud. Second, it develops a model-predictive algorithm for workload forecasting that is used for resource auto scaling. Finally, empirical results are provided that demonstrate that resources can be allocated and deal located by our algorithm in a way that satisfies both the application QoS while keeping operational costs low.},

This paper presents a novel, hybrid capacity planning process that results from a systematic blending of 1) analytical modeling, where traditional modeling techniques are enhanced to overcome their limitations in providing accurate performance estimates; 2) profile-based techniques, which determine performance profiles of individual software components for use in resource allocation and balancing resource usage; and 3) allocation heuristics that determine minimum number of resources to allocate software components. Our results illustrate that using our technique, performance (i.e., bounded response time) can be assured while reducing operating costs by using 25\% less resources and increasing revenues by handling 20\% more clients compared to traditional approaches.},

  abstract  = {Due to increase in number and complexity of the large scale systems, performance monitoring and multidimensional quality of service (QoS) management has become a difficult and error prone task for system administrators. Recently, the trend has been to use virtualization technology, which facilitates hosting of multiple distributed systems with minimum infrastructure cost via sharing of computational and memory resources among multiple instances, and allows dynamic creation of even bigger clusters. An effective monitoring technique should not only be fine grained with respect to the measured variables, but also should be able to provide a high level overview of the distributed systems to the administrator of all variables that can affect the QoS requirements. At the same time, the technique should not add performance burden to the system. Finally, it should be integrated with a control methodology that manages performance of the enterprise system. In this paper, a systematic distributed event based (DEB) performance monitoring approach is presented for distributed systems by measuring system variables (physical/virtual CPU utilization and memory utilization), application variables (application queue size, queue waiting time, and service time), and performance variables (response time, throughput, and power consumption) accurately with minimum latency at a specified rate. Furthermore, we have shown that proposed monitoring approach can be utilized to provide input to an application monitoring utility to understand the underlying performance model of the system for a successful on-line control of the distributed systems for achieving predefined QoS parameters.},

Testing and verification may not cover all possible scenarios that a system will encounter, hence a simpler, yet formally specified run-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault mitigation architecture is needed to increase the software system's dependability. The approach described in this paper borrows concepts and principles from the field of {\textquotedblleft}Systems Health Management{\textquotedblright} for complex systems and implements a two level health management strategy that can be applied through a model-based software development process. The Component-level Health Manager (CLHM) for software components provides a localized and limited functionality for managing the health of a component locally. It also reports to the higher-level System Health Manager (SHM) which manages the health of the overall system. SHM consists of a diagnosis engine that uses the timed fault propagation (TFPG) model based on the component assembly. It reasons about the anomalies reported by CLHM and hypothesizes about the possible fault sources. Thereafter, necessary system level mitigation action can be taken. System-level mitigation approaches are subject of on-going investigations and have not been included in this paper. We conclude the paper with case study and discussion.},

The two-level approach of Health Management at Component and System level  is demonstrated on a simulated case study of an Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU).  That subsystem was categorized as the primary failure source for the in-flight upset caused in the Malaysian Air flight 124 over Perth, Australia in August 2005.},

  abstract  = {The complexity of software in systems like aerospace vehicles has reached the point where new techniques are needed to ensure system dependability while improving the productivity of developers. One possible approach is to use precisely defined software execution platforms that (1) enable the system to be composed from separate components, (2) restrict component interactions and prevent fault propagation, and (3) whose compositional properties are well-known. In this paper we describe the initial steps towards building a platform that combines component-based software construction with hard real-time operating system services. Specifically, the paper discusses how the CORBA Component Model (CCM) could be combined with the ARINC-653 platform services and the lessons learned from this experiment. The results point towards both extending the CCM as well as revising the ARINC-653.},

This paper makes three contributions to the study of deployment and configuration middleware for DRE systems that satisfy multiple QoS properties. First, it describes a novel task allocation algorithm for passively replicated DRE systems to meet their real-time and fault-tolerance QoS properties while consuming significantly less resources. Second, it presents the design of a strategizable allocation engine that enables application developers to evaluate different allocation algorithms. Third, it presents the design of a middleware agnostic configuration framework that uses allocation decisions to deploy application components/replicas and configure the underlying middleware automatically on the chosen nodes. These contributions are realized in the DeCoRAM (Deployment and Configuration Reasoning and Analysis via Modeling) middleware. Empirical results on a distributed testbed demonstrate DeCoRAM's ability to handle multiple failures and provide efficient and predictable real-time performance.},

These systems need a reconfiguration mechanism that provides recovery from individual component failures as well as the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving mission goals. One way to provide this functionality is to define a model of alternative system configurations and allow the system to choose the current configuration based on its current state, including environmental parameters and goals. The primary difficulties with this approach are (1) the state space of configurations can grow very large, which can make explicit enumeration infeasible, and (2) the component failures and evolving system goals must be somehow encoded in the system configuration model. This paper describes an online reconfiguration method based on model-based designspace exploration. We symbolically encode the set of valid system configurations and assert the current system state and goals as symbolic constraints. Our initial work indicates that this method scales and is capable of providing effective online dynamic reconfiguration.},

  abstract  = {Large computing clusters used for scientific processing suffer from systemic failures when operated over long continuous periods for executing workflows. Diagnosing job problems and faults leading to eventual failures in this complex environment is difficult, specifically when the success of an entire workflow might be affected by a single job failure. In this paper, we introduce a model-based, hierarchical, reliable execution framework that encompass workflow specification, data provenance, execution tracking and online monitoring of each workflow task, also referred to as participants. The sequence of participants is described in an abstract parameterized view, which is translated into a concrete data dependency based sequence of participants with defined arguments. As participants belonging to a workflow are mapped onto machines and executed, periodic and on-demand monitoring of vital health parameters on allocated nodes is enabled according to pre-specified rules. These rules specify conditions that must be true pre-execution, during execution and post-execution. Monitoring information for each participant is propagated upwards through the reflex and healing architecture, which consists of a hierarchical network of decentralized fault management entities, called reflex engines. They are instantiated as state machines or timed automatons that change state and initiate reflexive mitigation action(s) upon occurrence of certain faults. We describe how this cluster reliability framework is combined with the workflow execution framework using formal rules and actions specified within a structure of first order predicate logic that enables a dynamic management design that reduces manual administrative workload, and increases cluster-productivity.},

  abstract  = {Fault-tolerant frameworks for large scale computing clusters require sensor programs, which are executed periodically to facilitate performance and fault management. By construction, these clusters use general purpose operating systems such as Linux that are built for best average case performance and do not provide deterministic scheduling guarantees. Consequently, periodic applications show jitter in execution times relative to the expected execution time. Obtaining a deterministic schedule for periodic tasks in general purpose operating systems is difficult without using kernel-level modifications such as RTAI and RTLinux. However, due to performance and administrative issues kernel modification cannot be used in all scenarios. In this paper, we address the problem of jitter compensation for periodic tasks that cannot rely on modifying the operating system kernel. ; Towards that, (a) we present motivating examples; (b) we present a feedback controller based approach that runs in the user space and actively compensates periodic schedule based on past jitter; This approach is platform-agnostic i.e. it can be used in different operating systems without modification; and (c) we show through analysis and experiments that this approach is platform-agnostic i.e. it can be used in different operating systems without modification and also that it maintains a stable system with bounded total jitter.},

  abstract  = {One of the primary problems with computing clusters is to ensure that they maintain a reliable working state most of the time to justify economics of operation. In this paper, we introduce a model-based hierarchical reliability framework that enables periodic monitoring of vital health parameters across the cluster and provides for autonomic fault mitigation. We also discuss some of the challenges faced by autonomic reliability frameworks in cluster environments such as non-determinism in task scheduling in standard operating systems such as Linux and need for synchronized execution of monitoring sensors across the cluster. Additionally, we present a solution to these problems in the context of our framework, which utilizes a feedback controller based approach to compensate for the scheduling jitter in non real-time operating systems. Finally, we present experimental data that illustrates the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract  = {Designing autonomic fault responses is difficult, particularly in large-scale systems, as there is no single {\textquoteleft}perfect{\textquoteright} fault mitigation response to a given failure. The design of appropriate mitigation actions depend upon the goals and state of the application and environment. Strict time deadlines in real-time systems further exacerbate this problem. Any autonomic behavior in such systems must not only be functionally correct but should also conform to properties of liveness, safety and bounded time responsiveness. This paper details a real-time fault-tolerant framework, which uses a reflex and healing architecture to provide fault mitigation capabilities for large-scale real-time systems. At the heart of this architecture is a real-time reflex engine, which has a state-based failure management logic that can respond to both event- and time-based triggers. We also present a semantic domain for verifying properties of systems, which use this framework of real-time reflex engines. Lastly, a case study, which examines the details of such an approach, is presented.},

Algorithms are used to specify how the state space of the system model should be explored in order to perform analysis. In ReachLab, both system models and analysis algorithm models are specified in the same framework using Hybrid System Analysis and Design Language (HADL), which is a meta-model based language. The platform allows the models of algorithms to be constructed hierarchically and promotes their reuse in constructing more complex algorithms. Moreover, the platform is designed in such a way that the concerns of design and implementation of analysis algorithms are separated. On one hand, the models of analysis algorithms are abstract and therefore the design of algorithms can be made independent of implementation details. On the other hand, translators are provided to automatically generate implementations from the models for computing analysis results based on computation kernels. Multiple computation kernels, which are based on specific computation tools such as d/dt and the Level Set toolbox, are supported and can be chosen to enable hybrid state space exploration. An example is provided to illustrate the design and implementation process in ReachLab.},

  abstract      = {Public transit is central to cultivating equitable communities. Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9\% and 65.1\% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time. Additionally, there was a significant difference in ridership decline between the highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77\% vs 58\%) in Nashville.},

  abstract  = {Recent technological advancements in computing, sensing and communication have led to the development of cyber-physical manufacturing processes, where a computing subsystem monitors the manufacturing process performance in real-time by analyzing sensor data and implements the necessary control to improve the product quality. This paper develops a predictive control framework where control actions are implemented after predicting the state of the manufacturing process or product quality at a future time using process models. In a cyber-physical manufacturing process, the product quality predictions may be affected by uncertainty sources from the computing subsystem (resource and communication uncertainty), manufacturing process (input uncertainty, process variability and modeling errors), and sensors (measurement uncertainty). In addition, due to the continuous interactions between the computing subsystem and the manufacturing process, these uncertainty sources may aggregate and compound over time. In some cases, some process parameters needed for model predictions may not be precisely known and may need to be derived from real time sensor data. This paper develops a dynamic Bayesian network approach, which enables the aggregation of multiple uncertainty sources, parameter estimation and robust prediction for online control. As the number of process parameters increase, their estimation using sensor data in real-time can be computationally expensive. To facilitate real-time analysis, variance-based global sensitivity analysis is used for dimension reduction. The proposed methodology of online monitoring and control under uncertainty, and dimension reduction, are illustrated for a cyber-physical turning process.},

Moving target defense (MTD) techniques such as instruction set randomization (ISR), address space randomization (ASR), and data space randomization (DSR) can be used to protect systems against such attacks. CPS often use time-triggered architectures to guarantee predictable and reliable operation. MTD techniques can cause time delays with unpredictable behavior. To protect CPS against memory corruption attacks, MTD techniques can be implemented in a mixed time and event-triggered architecture that provides capabilities for maintaining safety and availability during an attack. This paper presents a mixed time and event-triggered MTD security approach based on the ARINC 653 architecture that provides predictable and reliable operation during normal operation and rapid detection and reconfiguration upon detection of attacks. We leverage a hardware-in-the-loop testbed and an advanced emergency braking system (AEBS) case study to show the effectiveness of our approach.},

However, statistical analysis with large-scale spatiotemporal data in real-time is computationally challenging and can necessitate compromise in accuracy or problem simplification. The main contribution of this work is the presentation of a stream processing approach for real-time monitoring of resource equity in spatially-aware micromobility fleets. The approach makes localized updates to resource availability as needed, instead of batch computation of availability at regular update intervals. We find that the stream processing approach can compute, on average, 62 resource availability updates in the same execution time as a single batch computation. This advantage in processing time makes continuous real-time stream processing equivalent to a batch computation performed every 15 minutes, in terms of algorithm execution time. Since the stream processing approach considers every update to the fleet in real-time, resource availability is always up-to-date and there is no compromise in terms of accuracy.},

However, the quality of the DL models can degrade over time due to changes in the input data distribution, thereby requiring periodic model updates. Although cloud data-centers can meet the computational requirements of the resource-intensive and time-consuming model update task, transferring data from the edge devices to the cloud incurs a significant cost in terms of network bandwidth and are prone to data privacy issues. With the advent of GPU-enabled edge devices, the DL model update can be performed at the edge in a distributed manner using multiple connected edge devices. However, efficiently utilizing the edge resources for the model update is a hard problem due to the heterogeneity among the edge devices and the resource interference caused by the co-location of the DL model update task with latency-critical tasks running in the background. To overcome these challenges, we present Deep-Edge, a load- and interference-aware, fault-tolerant resource management framework for performing model update at the edge that uses distributed training. This paper makes the following contributions. First, it provides a unified framework for monitoring, profiling, and deploying the DL model update tasks on heterogeneous edge devices. Second, it presents a scheduler that reduces the total re-training time by appropriately selecting the edge devices and distributing data among them such that no latency-critical applications experience deadline violations. Finally, we present empirical results to validate the efficacy of the framework using a real-world DL model update case-study based on the Caltech dataset and an edge AI cluster testbed.},

Each engineering discipline commonly relies on domain-specific modeling languages, and analysis and execution of these models is often automated with appropriate tooling. However, integration between these heterogeneous models and tools is often lacking, and most of the burden for inter-operation of these tools is placed on system developers. To address this problem, we introduce a workflow modeling language for the automation of complex CPS development processes and implement a platform for execution of these models in the Assurance-based Learning-enabled CPS (ALC) Toolchain. Several illustrative examples are provided which show how these workflow models are able to automate many time-consuming integration tasks previously performed manually by system developers.

  year          = {2020},
  abstract      = {Public transit can have significantly lower environmental impact than personal vehicles; however, it still uses a substantial amount of energy, causing air pollution and greenhouse gas emission. While electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy use, most public transit agencies have to employ them in combination with conventional, internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high upfront costs of EVs. To make the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit agencies need to optimize route assignments and charging schedules, which presents a challenging problem for large public transit networks. We introduce a novel problem formulation to minimize fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit trips and scheduling them for charging while serving an existing fixed-route transit schedule. We present an integer program for optimal discrete-time scheduling, and we propose polynomial-time heuristic algorithms and a genetic algorithm for finding solutions for larger networks. We evaluate our algorithms on the transit service of a mid-size U.S. city using operational data collected from public transit vehicles. Our results show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and achieve near-minimum energy use.},

  abstract      = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are critical to the transition to a low-carbon transportation system. The successful adoption of EVs heavily depends on energy consumption models that can accurately and reliably estimate electricity consumption. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of EV energy consumption models, aiming to provide guidance for future development of EV applications. We summarize influential variables of EV energy consumption into four categories: vehicle component, vehicle dynamics, traffic and environment related factors. We classify and discuss EV energy consumption models in terms of modeling scale (microscopic vs. macroscopic) and methodology (data-driven vs. rule-based). Our review shows trends of increasing macroscopic models that can be used to estimate trip-level EV energy consumption and increasing data-driven models that utilized machine learning technologies to estimate EV energy consumption based on large volume real-world data. We identify research gaps for EV energy consumption models, including the development of energy estimation models for modes other than personal vehicles (e.g., electric buses, electric trucks, and electric non-road vehicles); the development of energy estimation models that are suitable for applications related to vehicle-to-grid integration; and the development of multi-scale energy estimation models as a holistic modeling approach.},

  abstract = {Memory corruption attacks such as code injection, code reuse, and non-control data attacks have become widely popular for compromising safety-critical Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS). Moving target defense (MTD) techniques such as instruction set randomization (ISR), address space randomization (ASR), and data space randomization (DSR) can be used to protect systems against such attacks. CPS often use time-triggered architectures to guarantee predictable and reliable operation. MTD techniques can cause time delays with unpredictable behavior. To protect CPS against memory corruption attacks, MTD techniques can be implemented in a mixed time and event-triggered architecture that provides capabilities for maintaining safety and availability during an attack. This paper presents a mixed time and event-triggered MTD security approach based on the ARINC 653 architecture that provides predictable and reliable operation during normal operation and rapid detection and reconfiguration upon detection of attacks. We leverage a hardware-in-the-loop testbed and an advanced emergency braking system (AEBS) case study to show the effectiveness of our approach.}

In this study, long-term transit bus monitoring data were utilized to empirically compare fuel consumption of diesel and hybrid buses under various driving conditions. Artificial neural network (ANN) based high-fidelity microscopic (1 Hz) and mesoscopic (5–60 min) fuel consumption models were developed for hybrid buses. The microscopic model contained 1 Hz driving, grade, and environment variables. The mesoscopic model aggregated 1 Hz data into 5 to 60-minute traffic pattern factors and predicted average fuel consumption over its duration. The prediction results show mean absolute percentage errors of 1–2\% for microscopic models and 5–8\% for mesoscopic models. The data were partitioned by different driving speeds, vehicle engine demand, and road grade to investigate their impacts on prediction performance.}

  abstract = {This paper focuses on building a spatio-temporal AI inference engine for estimating hard disk reliability. Most electronic systems such as hard disks routinely collect such reliability parameters in the field to monitor the health of the system. Changes in parameters as a function of time are monitored and any observed changes are compared with the known failure signatures. If the trajectory of the measured data matches that of a failure signature, operators are alerted to take corrective action. However, the interest of the operators lies in being able to identify the failures before they occur. The state of the art methodology including our prior work is to train machine learning models on temporal sequence data capturing the variations across multiple features and using it to predict the remaining useful life of the devices. However, as we show in this paper temporal prediction capability alone is not sufficient and can lead to low precision and the uncertainty around the prediction is very large. This is primarily due to the non-uniform progression of feature patterns over time. Our hypothesis is that the accuracy can be improved if we combine the temporal prediction methods with a spatial analysis that compares the value of key SMART features of the devices across similar model in a fixed time window (unlike the temporal method which uses the data from a single device and a much larger historical window). In this paper, we first describe both temporal and spatial approaches, describe the methods to select various hyperparameters, and then show a workflow to combine these two methodologies and provide comparative results. Our results illustrate that the average precision of temporal methods using long-short temporal memory networks to predict impending failures in the next ten days was 84 percent. To improve precision, we use the set of disks identified as potential failures and start applying spatial anomaly detection methods on those disks. This helps us remove the false positives from the temporal prediction results and provide a tighter bound on the set of disks with impending failure.}

The certification processes for these systems are stringent and require robust safety assurance arguments and substantial evidence backing. Despite the strict requirements, current practices still rely on manual methods that are brittle, do not have a systematic approach or thorough consideration of sound arguments. In addition, stringent certification requirements and ever-increasing system complexity make ad-hoc, manual assurance case generation (ACG) inefficient, time consuming, and expensive. To improve the current state of practice, we introduce a structured ACG tool which uses system design artifacts, accumulated evidence, and developer expertise to construct a safety case and evaluate it in an automated manner. We also illustrate the applicability of the ACG tool on a remote-control car testbed case study.},
