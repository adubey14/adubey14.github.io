abstract: The realization of edge-based cyber-physical systems (CPS) poses important
  challenges in terms of performance, robustness, security, etc. This paper examines
  a novel approach to providing a user-centric adaptive route planning service over
  a network of Road Side Units (RSUs) in smart cities. The key idea is to adaptively
  select routing task parameters such as privacy-cloaked area sizes and number of
  retained intersections to balance processing time, privacy protection level, and
  route accuracy for privacy-augmented distributed route search while also handling
  per-query user preferences. This is formulated as an optimization problem with a
  set of parameters giving the best result for a set of queries given system constraints.
  Processing Throughput, Privacy Protection, and Travel Time Accuracy were developed
  as the objective functions to be balanced. A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm based
  technique (NSGA-II) is applied to recover a feasible solution. The performance of
  this approach was then evaluated using traffic data from Osaka, Japan. Results show
  good performance of the approach in balancing the aforementioned objectives based
  on user preferences.
