abstract: Complex sensing, processing and control applications running on distributed
  platforms are difficult to design, develop, analyze, integrate, deploy and operate,
  especially if resource constraints, fault tolerance and security issues are to be
  addressed. While technology exists today for engineering distributed, real-time
  component-based applications, many problems remain unsolved by existing tools. Model-driven
  development techniques are powerful, but there are very few existing and complete
  tool chains that offer an end-to-end solution to developers, from design to deployment.
  There is a need for an integrated model-driven development environment that addresses
  all phases of application lifecycle including design, development, verification,
  analysis, integration, deployment, operation and maintenance, with supporting automation
  in every phase. Arguably, a centerpiece of such a model-driven environment is the
  modeling language. To that end, this paper presents a wide-spectrum architecture
  design language called DREMS ML that itself is an integrated collection of individual
  domain-specific sub-languages. We claim that the language promotes “correct-by-construction”
  software development and integration by supporting each individual phase of the
  application lifecycle. Using a case study, we demonstrate how the design of DREMS
  ML impacts the development of embedded systems.
