abstract: 'This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and
  propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart
  system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for
  proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong
  feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities
  of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs
  at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation,
  sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem.
  In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward
  system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one
  at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate
  uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The
  DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models,
  physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design
  of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network)
  within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe
  that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system
  compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.'
