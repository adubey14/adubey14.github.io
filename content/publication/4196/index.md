abstract: The complexity of software systems has reached the point where we need run-time
  mechanisms that can be used to provide fault management services. Testing and verification
  may not cover all possible scenarios that a system can encounter, hence a simpler,
  yet formally specified run-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault mitigation architecture
  is needed to increase the software systemtextquoterights dependability. The approach
  described in this paper borrows concepts and principles from the field of textquoteleftSystems
  Health Managementtextquoteright for complex systems. The paper introduces the fundamental
  ideas for software health management, and then illustrates how these can be implemented
  in a model-based software development process, including a case study and related
  work.
