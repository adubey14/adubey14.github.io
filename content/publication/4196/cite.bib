 abstract = {The complexity of software systems has reached the point where we need run-time mechanisms that
can be used to provide fault management services. Testing and verification may not cover all possible
scenarios that a system can encounter, hence a simpler, yet formally specified run-time monitoring,
diagnosis, and fault mitigation architecture is needed to increase the software system\textquoterights dependability.
The approach described in this paper borrows concepts and principles from the field of \textquoteleftSystems Health
Management\textquoteright for complex systems. The paper introduces the fundamental ideas for software health
management, and then illustrates how these can be implemented in a model-based software development process, including a case study and related work.},
