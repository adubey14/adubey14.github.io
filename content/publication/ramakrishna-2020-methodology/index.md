abstract: Safety Case has become an integral component for safety-certification in
  various Cyber Physical System domains including automotive, aviation, medical devices,
  and military. The certification processes for these systems are stringent and require
  robust safety assurance arguments and substantial evidence backing. Despite the
  strict requirements, current practices still rely on manual methods that are brittle,
  do not have a systematic approach or thorough consideration of sound arguments.
  In addition, stringent certification requirements and ever-increasing system complexity
  make ad-hoc, manual assurance case generation (ACG) inefficient, time consuming,
  and expensive. To improve the current state of practice, we introduce a structured
  ACG tool which uses system design artifacts, accumulated evidence, and developer
  expertise to construct a safety case and evaluate it in an automated manner. We
  also illustrate the applicability of the ACG tool on a remote-control car testbed
  case study.
