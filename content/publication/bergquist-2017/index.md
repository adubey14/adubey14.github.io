abstract: Transactive microgrids are emerging as a transformative solution for the
  problems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase in the use of
  distributed energy resources and a rapid acceleration in renewable energy generation,
  such as wind and solar power. Distributed ledgers have recently found widespread
  interest in this domain due to their ability to provide transactional integrity
  across decentralized computing nodes. However, the existing state of the art has
  not focused on the privacy preservation requirement of these energy systems -- the
  transaction level data can provide much greater insights into a prosumer's behavior
  compared to smart meter data. There are specific safety requirements in transactive
  microgrids to ensure the stability of the grid and to control the load. To fulfil
  these requirements, the distribution system operator needs transaction information
  from the grid, which poses a further challenge to the privacy-goals. This problem
  is made worse by requirement for off-blockchain communication in these networks.
  In this paper, we extend a recently developed trading workflow called PETra and
  describe our solution for communication and transactional anonymity.
