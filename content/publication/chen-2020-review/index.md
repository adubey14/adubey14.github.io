abstract: 'Electric vehicles (EVs) are critical to the transition to a low-carbon
  transportation system. The successful adoption of EVs heavily depends on energy
  consumption models that can accurately and reliably estimate electricity consumption.
  This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of EV energy consumption models, aiming
  to provide guidance for future development of EV applications. We summarize influential
  variables of EV energy consumption into four categories: vehicle component, vehicle
  dynamics, traffic and environment related factors. We classify and discuss EV energy
  consumption models in terms of modeling scale (microscopic vs. macroscopic) and
  methodology (data-driven vs. rule-based). Our review shows trends of increasing
  macroscopic models that can be used to estimate trip-level EV energy consumption
  and increasing data-driven models that utilized machine learning technologies to
  estimate EV energy consumption based on large volume real-world data. We identify
  research gaps for EV energy consumption models, including the development of energy
  estimation models for modes other than personal vehicles (e.g., electric buses,
  electric trucks, and electric non-road vehicles); the development of energy estimation
  models that are suitable for applications related to vehicle-to-grid integration;
  and the development of multi-scale energy estimation models as a holistic modeling
  approach.'
