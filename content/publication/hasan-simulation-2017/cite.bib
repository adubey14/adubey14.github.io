 abstract = {Electrical power systems are heavily instrumented with protection assemblies (relays and breakers) that detect anomalies and arrest failure propagation. However, failures in these discrete protection devices could have inadvertent consequences, including cascading failures resulting in blackouts. This paper aims to model the behavior of these discrete protection devices in nominal and faulty conditions and apply it towards simulation and contingency analysis of cascading failures in power transmission systems. The behavior under fault conditions are used to identify and explain conditions for blackout evolution which are not otherwise obvious. The results are demonstrated using a standard IEEE-14 Bus System.},
