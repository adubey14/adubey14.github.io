abstract: Recent advances in machine learning led to the appearance of Learning-Enabled
  Components (LECs) in Cyber-Physical Systems. LECs are being evaluated and used for
  various, complex functions including perception and control. However, very little
  tool support is available for design automation in such systems. This paper introduces
  an integrated toolchain that supports the architectural modeling of CPS with LECs,
  but also has extensive support for the engineering and integration of LECs, including
  support for training data collection, LEC training, LEC evaluation and verification,
  and system software deployment. Additionally, the toolsuite supports the modeling
  and analysis of safety cases - a critical part of the engineering process for mission
  and safety critical systems.
