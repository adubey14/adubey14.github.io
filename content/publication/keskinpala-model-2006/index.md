abstract: This paper presents a contribution to the challenges of manually creating
  test configurations and deployments for high performance distributed middleware
  frameworks. We present our testing tool based on the Model Integrated Computing
  (MIC) paradigm and describe and discuss its generative abilities that can be used
  to generate many test configurations and deployment scenarios from high-level system
  specifications through model replication.
