abstract: The fog/edge computing paradigm is increasingly being adopted to support
  a range of latency-sensitive IoT services due to its ability to assure the latency
  requirements of these services while supporting the elastic properties of cloud
  computing. IoT services that cater to user mobility, however, face a number of challenges
  in this context. First, since user mobility can incur wireless connectivity issues,
  executing these services entirely on edge resources, such as smartphones, will result
  in a rapid drain in the battery charge. In contrast, executing these services entirely
  on fog resources, such as cloudlets or micro data centers, will incur higher communication
  costs and increased latencies in the face of fluctuating wireless connectivity and
  signal strength. Second, a high degree of multi-tenancy on fog resources involving
  different IoT services can lead to performance interference issues due to resource
  contention. In order to address these challenges, this paper describes URMILA, which
  makes dynamic resource management decisions to achieve effective trade-offs between
  using the fog and edge resources yet ensuring that the latency requirements of the
  IoT services are met. We evaluate URMILAtextquoterights capabilities in the context
  of a real-world use case on an emulated but realistic IoT testbed.
