abstract: Edge and Fog computing paradigms are used to process big data generated
  by the increasing number of IoT devices. These paradigms have enabled cities to
  become smarter in various aspects via real-time data-driven applications. While
  these have addressed some flaws of cloud computing some challenges remain particularly
  in terms of privacy and security. We create a testbed based on a distributed processing
  platform called the Information flow of Things (IFoT) middleware. We briefly describe
  a decentralized traffic speed query and routing service implemented on this framework
  testbed. We configure the testbed to test countermeasure systems that aim to address
  the security challenges faced by prior paradigms. Using this testbed, we investigate
  a novel decentralized anomaly detection approach for time-sensitive distributed
  smart transportation systems.
