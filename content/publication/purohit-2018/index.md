abstract: The Web has empowered emergency services to enhance operations by collecting
  real-time information about incidents from diverse data sources such as social media.
  However, the high volume of unstructured data from the heterogeneous sources with
  varying degrees of veracity challenges the timely extraction and integration of
  relevant information to summarize the current situation. Existing work on event
  detection and summarization on social media relates to this challenge of timely
  extraction of information during an evolving event. However, it is limited in both
  integrating incomplete information from diverse sources and using the integrated
  information to dynamically infer knowledge representation of the situation that
  captures optimal actions (e.g., allocate available finite ambulances to incident
  regions). In this paper, we present a novel concept of an Uncertain Concept Graph
  (UCG) that is capable of representing dynamic knowledge of a disaster event from
  heterogeneous data sources, particularly for the regions of interest, and resources/services
  required. The information sources, incident regions, and resources (e.g., ambulances)
  are represented as nodes in UCG, while the edges represent the weighted relationships
  between these nodes. We then propose a solution for probabilistic edge inference
  between nodes in UCG. We model a novel optimization problem for the edge assignment
  between a service resource to a region node over time trajectory. The output of
  such structured summarization over time can be valuable for modeling event dynamics
  in the real world beyond emergency management, across different smart city operations
  such as transportation.
