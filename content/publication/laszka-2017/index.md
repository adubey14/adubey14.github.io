abstract: Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable
  energy resources and improvements in battery technology. While these changes enhance
  sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges
  as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized
  Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities
  into transactive microgrids. Within a transactive microgrid, “prosumers” (i.e.,
  consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with
  each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is
  hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive
  energy system. On the one hand, prosumerstextquoteright personal information must
  be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand,
  the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize
  the entire grid. This paper describes Privacypreserving Energy  of cyb (PETra),
  which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers
  to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers,
  such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading.
