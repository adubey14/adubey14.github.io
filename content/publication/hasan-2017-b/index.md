abstract: Cascading failures in electrical power systems are one of the major causes
  of concern for the modem society as it results in huge socio-economic loss. Tools
  for analyzing these failures while considering different aspects of the system are
  typically very expensive. Thus, researchers tend to use multiple tools to perform
  various types of analysis on the same system model in order to understand the reasons
  for these failures in detail. Modeling a simple system in multiple platforms is
  a tedious, error prone and time consuming process. This paper describes a domain
  specific modeling language (DSML) for power systems. It identifies and captures
  the right abstractions for modeling components in different analysis tools. A framework
  is proposed that deals with system modeling using the developed DSML, identifying
  the type of analysis to be performed, choosing the appropriate tool(s) needed for
  the analysis from the tool-chain, transforming the model based on the required specifications
  of a particular tool and performing the analysis. A case study is done on WSCC-9
  Bus System, IEEE-14 Bus System and IEEE-39 Bus System to demonstrate the entire
  workflow of the framework in identifying critical components for power systems.
