 abstract = {Cascading failures in electrical power systems are one of the major causes of concern for the modem society as it results in huge socio-economic loss. Tools for analyzing these failures while considering different aspects of the system are typically very expensive. Thus, researchers tend to use multiple tools to perform various types of analysis on the same system model in order to understand the reasons for these failures in detail. Modeling a simple system in multiple platforms is a tedious, error prone and time consuming process. This paper describes a domain specific modeling language (DSML) for power systems. It identifies and captures the right abstractions for modeling components in different analysis tools. A framework is proposed that deals with system modeling using the developed DSML, identifying the type of analysis to be performed, choosing the appropriate tool(s) needed for the analysis from the tool-chain, transforming the model based on the required specifications of a particular tool and performing the analysis. A case study is done on WSCC-9 Bus System, IEEE-14 Bus System and IEEE-39 Bus System to demonstrate the entire workflow of the framework in identifying critical components for power systems.},
