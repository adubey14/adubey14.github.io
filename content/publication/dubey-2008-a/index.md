abstract: One of the primary problems with computing clusters is to ensure that they
  maintain a reliable working state most of the time to justify economics of operation.
  In this paper, we introduce a model-based hierarchical reliability framework that
  enables periodic monitoring of vital health parameters across the cluster and provides
  for autonomic fault mitigation. We also discuss some of the challenges faced by
  autonomic reliability frameworks in cluster environments such as non-determinism
  in task scheduling in standard operating systems such as Linux and need for synchronized
  execution of monitoring sensors across the cluster. Additionally, we present a solution
  to these problems in the context of our framework, which utilizes a feedback controller
  based approach to compensate for the scheduling jitter in non real-time operating
  systems. Finally, we present experimental data that illustrates the effectiveness
  of our approach.
