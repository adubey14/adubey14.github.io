abstract: Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is one of the most capa- ble online search
  algorithms for sequential planning tasks, with sig- nificant applications in areas
  such as resource allocation and transit planning. Despite its strong performance
  in real-world deployment, the inherent complexity of MCTS makes it challenging to
  understand for users without technical background. This paper considers the use
  of MCTS in transportation routing services, where the algorithm is integrated to
  develop optimized route plans. These plans are required to meet a range of constraints
  and requirements simultaneously, fur- ther complicating the task of explaining the
  algorithmâ€™s operation in real-world contexts. To address this critical research
  gap, we intro- duce a novel computation tree logic-based explainer for MCTS. Our
  framework begins by taking user-defined requirements and translat- ing them into
  rigorous logic specifications through the use of lan- guage templates. Then, our
  explainer incorporates a logic verifica- tion and quantitative evaluation module
  that validates the states and actions traversed by the MCTS algorithm. The outcomes
  of this anal- ysis are then rendered into human-readable descriptive text using
  a second set of language templates. The user satisfaction of our ap- proach was
  assessed through a survey with 82 participants. The re- sults indicated that our
  explanatory approach significantly outper- forms other baselines in user preference.
