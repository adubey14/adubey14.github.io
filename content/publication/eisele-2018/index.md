abstract: Internet of Things and data sciences are fueling the development of innovative
  solutions for various applications in Smart and Connected Communities (SCC). These
  applications provide participants with the capability to exchange not only data
  but also resources, which raises the concerns of integrity, trust, and above all
  the need for fair and optimal solutions to the problem of resource allocation. This
  exchange of information and resources leads to a problem where the stakeholders
  of the system may have limited trust in each other. Thus, collaboratively reaching
  consensus on when, how, and who should access certain resources becomes problematic.
  This paper presents SolidWorx, a blockchain-based platform that provides key mechanisms
  required for arbitrating resource consumption across different SCC applications
  in a domain-agnostic manner. For example, it introduces and implements a hybrid-solver
  pattern, where complex optimization computation is handled off-blockchain while
  solution validation is performed by a smart contract. To ensure correctness, the
  smart contract of SolidWorx is generated and verified using a model-based approach.
