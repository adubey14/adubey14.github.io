abstract: 'Summary Using the Smart Home as a use case, we examine the vulnerabilities
  in the system across the technologies used in its implementation. A typical smart
  home will contain a variety of sensors, actuators (e.g. for opening doors), communication
  links, storage devices, video cameras, network interfaces, and control units. Each
  of these physical components and subsystems must be secure in order for the overall
  system to be secure. Typical security analysis focuses on the defined interfaces
  of the system: network security via firewalls, communications encryption, and authentication
  at terminals. Unfortunately, many of these devices in the Internet of Things (IoT)
  space are susceptible to physical attacks via electromagnetic energy, or other sound/heat
  energy. Properly designed electromagnetic (EM) waveforms can access a range of vulnerabilities,
  providing unanticipated entry points into the system. In this chapter, we discuss
  a multi-modeling methodology for analyzing cyber-physical vulnerabilities, assessing
  the system across geometry, electronic, and behavioral domains. A home automation
  system is used as an example, showing a methodology for assessing vulnerabilities
  in hardware. The example exploits the use of EM energy injection. A multi-modeling
  of the system captures the geometric structure of the hardware with links to behavioral
  models. Low-energy EM pathways are discovered that may impact system behavior. Computation
  is minimized by applying analysis of EM effects only at behavior-critical inputs
  and outputs. The chapter also discusses a methodology for system-level impact analysis.
  The final conclusion is that susceptibility to physical layer presents many attack
  surfaces, due to a large number of heterogeneous IoT devices, mandating consideration
  of the physical dimensions to vulnerability analysis and risk mitigation.'
