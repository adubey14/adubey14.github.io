abstract: To seamlessly reconnect an islanded microgrid to the main grid, voltage
  phasors on both sides of the point of common coupling need to be synchronized before
  the main relay closes. In this paper, a distributed control strategy is proposed
  for microgrid synchronization operation. The proposed controller design utilizes
  pinning-based consensus algorithm to avoid system single point of failure. It is
  able to actively track the main grid frequency, provide a good coordination between
  frequency and phase regulation and ensure all distributed generations in the system
  proportionally share the load. Implementation of such distributed algorithm in practice
  is difficult because it requires mitigation of both distributed computing and power
  system engineering challenges. In this paper, a novel software platform called RIAPS
  platform is presented that helps implementing the proposed distributed synchronization
  strategy in practical hardware controllers. The performance of the controllers are
  validated using a real-time controller hardware-in-the-loop microgrid testbed.
