abstract: Wider adoption, availability and ubiquity of wireless networking technologies,
  integrated sensors, actuators, and edge computing devices is facilitating a paradigm
  shift by allowing us to transition from traditional statically configured vertical
  silos of CyberPhysical Systems (CPS) to next generation CPS that are more open,
  dynamic and extensible. Fractionated spacecraft, smart cities computing architectures,
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clusters, platoon of vehicles on highways are all
  examples of extensible CPS wherein extensibility is implied by the dynamic aggregation
  of physical resources, affect of physical dynamics on availability of computing
  resources, and various multi-domain applications hosted on these systems. However,
  realization of extensible CPS requires resolving design-time and run-time challenges
  emanating from properties specific to these systems. In this paper, we first describe
  different properties of extensible CPS - dynamism, extensibility, remote deployment,
  security, heterogeneity and resilience. Then we identify different design-time challenges
  stemming from heterogeneity and resilience requirements. We particularly focus on
  software heterogeneity arising from availability of various communication middleware.
  We then present appropriate solutions in the context of a novel domain specific
  language, which can be used to design resilient systems while remaining agnostic
  to middleware heterogeneities. We also describe how this language and its features
  have evolved from our past work. We use a platform of fractionated spacecraft to
  describe our solution.
