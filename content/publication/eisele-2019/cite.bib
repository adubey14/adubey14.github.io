 abstract = {The modern electric grid is a complex, decentralized cyber-physical system requiring higher-level control techniques to balance the demand and supply of energy to optimize the overall energy usage. The concept of Transactive Energy utilizes distributed system principle to address this challenge. In this demonstration we show the usage of the distributed application management platform RIAPS in the implementation of one such Transactive Energy approach to control elements of a power system, which runs as a a simulation using the Gridlab-d simulation solver.},
