abstract: The modern electric grid is a complex, decentralized cyber-physical system
  requiring higher-level control techniques to balance the demand and supply of energy
  to optimize the overall energy usage. The concept of Transactive Energy utilizes
  distributed system principle to address this challenge. In this demonstration we
  show the usage of the distributed application management platform RIAPS in the implementation
  of one such Transactive Energy approach to control elements of a power system, which
  runs as a a simulation using the Gridlab-d simulation solver.
