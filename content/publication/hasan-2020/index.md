abstract: Technological advancements in todays electrical grids give rise to new vulnerabilities
  and increase the potential attack surface for cyber-attacks that can severely affect
  the resilience of the grid. Cyber-attacks are increasing both in number as well
  as sophistication and these attacks can be strategically organized in chronological
  order (dynamic attacks), where they can be instantiated at different time instants.
  The chronological order of attacks enables us to uncover those attack combinations
  that can cause severe system damage but this concept remained unexplored due to
  the lack of dynamic attack models. Motivated by the idea, we consider a game-theoretic
  approach to design a new attacker-defender model for power systems. Here, the attacker
  can strategically identify the chronological order in which the critical substations
  and their protection assemblies can be attacked in order to maximize the overall
  system damage. However, the defender can intelligently identify the critical substations
  to protect such that the system damage can be minimized. We apply the developed
  algorithms to the IEEE-39 and 57 bus systems with finite attacker/defender budgets.
  Our results show the effectiveness of these models in improving the system resilience
  under dynamic attacks.
