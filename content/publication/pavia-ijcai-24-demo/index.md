abstract: New rideshare and shared mobility services have transformed urban mobility
  in recent years. Such services have the potential to improve efficiency and reduce
  costs by allowing users to share rides in high-capacity vehicles and vans. Most
  transit agencies already operate various ridepooling services, including microtransit
  and paratransit. However, the objectives and constraints for implementing these
  services vary greatly between agencies and can be challenging. First, off-the-shelf
  ridepooling formulations must be adapted for real-world conditions and constraints.
  Second, the lack of modular and reusable software makes it hard to implement and
  evaluate new ridepooling algorithms and approaches in real-world settings. We demonstrate
  a modular on-demand public transportation scheduling software for microtransit and
  paratransit services. The software is aimed at transit agencies looking to incorporate
  state-of-the-art rideshare and ridepooling algorithms in their everyday operations.
  We provide management software for dispatchers and mobile applications for drivers
  and users and conclude with results from the demonstration in Chattanooga, TN.
