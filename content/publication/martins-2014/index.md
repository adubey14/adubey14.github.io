abstract: An important challenge in networked control systems is to ensure the confidentiality
  and integrity of the message in order to secure the communication and prevent attackers
  or intruders from compromising the system. However, security mechanisms may jeopardize
  the temporal behavior of the network data communication because of the computation
  and communication overhead. In this paper, we study the effect of adding Hash Based
  Message Authentication (HMAC) to a time-triggered networked control system. Time
  Triggered Architectures (TTAs) provide a deterministic and predictable timing behavior
  that is used to ensure safety, reliability and fault tolerance properties. The paper
  analyzes the computation and communication overhead of adding HMAC and the impact
  on the performance of the time-triggered network. Experimental validation and performance
  evaluation results using a TTEthernet network are also presented.
