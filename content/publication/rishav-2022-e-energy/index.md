abstract: When electrified transit systems make grid aware choices, improved social
  welfare is achieved by reducing grid stress, reducing system loss, and minimizing
  power quality issues. Electrifying transit fleet has numerous challenges like non
  availability of buses during charging, varying charging costs and so on, that are
  related the electric grid behavior. However, transit systems do not have access
  to the information about the co-evolution of the grid's power flow and therefore
  cannot account for the power grid's needs in its day-to-day operation. In this paper
  we propose a framework of transportation-grid co-simulation, analyzing the spatio-temporal
  interaction between the transit operations with electric buses and the power distribution
  grid. Real-world data for a day's traffic from Chattanooga city's transit system
  is simulated in SUMO and integrated with a realistic distribution grid simulation
  (using GridLAB-D) to understand the grid impact due to transit electrification.
  Charging information is obtained from the transportation simulation to feed into
  grid simulation to assess the impact of charging. We also discuss the impact to
  the grid with higher degree of transit electrification that further necessitates
  such an integrated transportation-grid co-simulation to operate the integrated system
  optimally. Our future work includes extending the platform for optimizing the charging
  and trip assignment operations.
