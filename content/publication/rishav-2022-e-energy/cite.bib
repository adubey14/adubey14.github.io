 abstract = {When electrified transit systems make grid aware choices, improved social welfare is achieved by reducing grid stress, reducing system loss, and minimizing power quality issues. Electrifying transit fleet has numerous challenges like non availability of buses during charging, varying charging costs and so on, that are related the electric grid behavior. However, transit systems do not have access to the information about the co-evolution of the grid's power flow and therefore cannot account for the power grid's needs in its day-to-day operation. In this paper we propose a framework of transportation-grid co-simulation, analyzing the spatio-temporal interaction between the transit operations with electric buses and the power distribution grid. Real-world data for a day's traffic from Chattanooga city's transit system is simulated in SUMO and integrated with a realistic distribution grid simulation (using GridLAB-D) to understand the grid impact due to transit electrification. Charging information is obtained from the transportation simulation to feed into grid simulation to assess the impact of charging. We also discuss the impact to the grid with higher degree of transit electrification that further necessitates such an integrated transportation-grid co-simulation to operate the integrated system optimally. Our future work includes extending the platform for optimizing the charging and trip assignment operations.},
