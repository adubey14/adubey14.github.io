abstract: Data centers and computing service providers are striving to improve the
  utilization of their computing resources. This is primarily due to the need of resources
  to be more economical and power efficient. Virtualization is one of the concepts
  that provide flexibility to host multiple operating system stacks on a single hardware.
  By effectively partitioning the computing resources, it reduces the total number
  of physical servers and consolidates several services on a single physical rack.
  Each virtual machine behaves like an independent machine (may be duplicate of the
  original one) while the scheduling of hardware resources among different virtual
  machines is performed with the help of a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). Proliferation
  of virtual machines in the enterprise architecture creates need for identification
  of potential security risks as well as appropriate solutions for the identified
  risks to ensure the integrity of the underlying applications hosted at the virtual
  machines. This paper describes available virtualization technologies, corresponding
  security vulnerabilities, and available solutions.
