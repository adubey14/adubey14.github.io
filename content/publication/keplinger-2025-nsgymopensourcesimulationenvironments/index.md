abstract: In many real-world applications, agents must make sequential decisions in
  environments where conditions are subject to change due to various exogenous factors.
  These non-stationary environments pose significant challenges to traditional decision-making
  models, which typically assume stationary dynamics. Non-stationary Markov decision
  processes (NS-MDPs) offer a framework to model and solve decision problems under
  such changing conditions. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks and simulation
  tools has hindered systematic evaluation and advance in this field. We present NS-Gym,
  the first simulation toolkit designed explicitly for NS-MDPs, integrated within
  the popular Gymnasium framework. In NS-Gym, we segregate the evolution of the environmental
  parameters that characterize non-stationarity from the agent's decision-making module,
  allowing for modular and flexible adaptations to dynamic environments. We review
  prior work in this domain and present a toolkit encapsulating key problem characteristics
  and types in NS-MDPs. This toolkit is the first effort to develop a set of standardized
  interfaces and benchmark problems to enable consistent and reproducible evaluation
  of algorithms under non-stationary conditions. We also benchmark six algorithmic
  approaches from prior work on NS-MDPs using NS-Gym. Our vision is that NS-Gym will
  enable researchers to assess the adaptability and robustness of their decision-making
  algorithms to non-stationary conditions.
