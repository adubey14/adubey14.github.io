abstract: Data generated by GPS-equipped probe vehicles, especially public transit
  vehicles can be a reliable source for traffic speed estimation. Traditionally, this
  estimation is done by learning the parameters of a model that describes the relationship
  between the speed of the probe vehicle and the actual traffic speed. However, such
  approaches typically suffer from data sparsity issues. Furthermore, most state of
  the art approaches does not consider the effect of weather and the driver of the
  probe vehicle on the parameters of the learned model. In this paper, we describe
  a multivariate predictive multi-model approach called SpeedPro that (a) first identifies
  similar clusters of operation from the historic data that includes the real-time
  position of the probe vehicle, the weather data, and anonymized driver identifier,
  and then (b) uses these different models to estimate the traffic speed in real-time
  as a function of current weather, driver and probe vehicle speed. When the real-time
  information is not available our approach uses a different model that uses the historical
  weather and traffic information for estimation. Our results show that the purely
  historical data is less accurate than the model that uses the real-time information.
