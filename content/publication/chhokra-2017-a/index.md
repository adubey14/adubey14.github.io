abstract: Reliable operation of cyber-physical systems such as power transmission
  and distribution systems is crtiical for the seamless functioning of a vibrant economy.
  These systems consist of tightly coupled physical (energy sources, transmission
  and distribution lines, and loads) and computational components (protection devices,
  energy management systems, etc.). The protection devices such as distance relays
  help in preventing failure propagation by isolating faulty physical components.
  However, these devices rely on hard thresholds and local information, often ignoring
  system-level effects introduced by the distributed control algorithms. This leads
  to scenarios wherein a local mitigation in a subsytem could trigger a larger fault
  cascade, possibly resulting in a blackout.Efficient models and tools that curtail
  such systematic failures by performing fault diagnosis and prognosis are therefore
  necessary.
