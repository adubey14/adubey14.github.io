abstract: The number of emergencies have increased over the years with the growth
  in urbanization. This pattern has overwhelmed the emergency services with limited
  resources and demands the optimization of response processes. It is partly due to
  traditional `reactive' approach of emergency services to collect data about incidents,
  where a source initiates a call to the emergency number (e.g., 911 in U.S.), delaying
  and limiting the potentially optimal response. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Waze
  provides an opportunity to develop a rapid, `proactive' approach to collect data
  about incidents through crowd-generated observational reports. However, the reliability
  of reporting sources and spatio-temporal uncertainty of the reported incidents challenge
  the design of such a proactive approach. Thus, this paper presents a novel method
  for emergency incident detection using noisy crowdsourced Waze data. We propose
  a principled computational framework based on Bayesian theory to model the uncertainty
  in the reliability of crowd-generated reports and their integration across space
  and time to detect incidents. Extensive experiments using data collected from Waze
  and the official reported incidents in Nashville, Tenessee in the U.S. show our
  method can outperform strong baselines for both F1-score and AUC. The application
  of this work provides an extensible framework to incorporate different noisy data
  sources for proactive incident detection to improve and optimize emergency response
  operations in our communities.
