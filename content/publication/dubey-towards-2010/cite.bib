 abstract = {The complexity of software systems has reached the point where we need run-time mechanisms that can be used to provide fault management services. Testing and verification may not cover all possible scenarios that a system can encounter, hence a simpler, yet formally specified run-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault mitigation architecture is needed to increase the software system’s dependability. The approach described in this paper borrows concepts and principles from the field of ‘Systems Health Management’ for complex systems. The paper introduces the fundamental ideas for software health management, and then illustrates how these can be implemented in a model-based software development process, including a case study and related work.},
