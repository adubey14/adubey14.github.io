abstract: The complexity of software systems has reached the point where we need run-time
  mechanisms that can be used to provide fault management services. Testing and verification
  may not cover all possible scenarios that a system can encounter, hence a simpler,
  yet formally specified run-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault mitigation architecture
  is needed to increase the software system’s dependability. The approach described
  in this paper borrows concepts and principles from the field of ‘Systems Health
  Management’ for complex systems. The paper introduces the fundamental ideas for
  software health management, and then illustrates how these can be implemented in
  a model-based software development process, including a case study and related work.
