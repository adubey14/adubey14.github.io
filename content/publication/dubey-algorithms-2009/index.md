abstract: A large number of embedded computing systems are modeled as hybrid system
  with both discrete and continuous dynamics. In this paper, we present algorithms
  for analyzing nonlinear time-invariant continuous-time systems by employing reachability
  algorithms. We propose synthesis algorithms for finding sets of initial states for
  the continuous dynamical systems so that temporal properties, such as safety and
  liveness properties, are satisfied. The initial sets produced by the algorithms
  are related to some classical concepts for continuous dynamical systems, such as
  invariant sets and domains of attraction.
