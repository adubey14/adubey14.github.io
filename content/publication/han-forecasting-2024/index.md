abstract: Public transportation systems often suffer from unexpected fluctuations
  in demand and disruptions, such as mechanical failures and medical emergencies.
  These fluctuations and disruptions lead to delays and overcrowding, which are detrimental
  to the passengers' experience and to the overall performance of the transit service.
  To proactively mitigate such events, many transit agencies station substitute (reserve)
  vehicles throughout their service areas, which they can dispatch to augment or replace
  vehicles on routes that suffer overcrowding or disruption. However, determining
  the optimal locations where substitute vehicles should be stationed is a challenging
  problem due to the inherent randomness of disruptions and due to the combinatorial
  nature of selecting locations across a city. In collaboration with the transit agency
  of a mid-size U.S. city, we address this problem by introducing data-driven statistical
  and machine-learning models for forecasting disruptions and an effective randomized
  local-search algorithm for selecting locations where substitute vehicles are to
  be stationed. Our research demonstrates promising results in proactive disruption
  management, offering a practical and easily implementable solution for transit agencies
  to enhance the reliability of their services. Our results resonate beyond mere operational
  efficiencyâ€”by advancing proactive strategies, our approach fosters more resilient
  and accessible public transportation, contributing to equitable urban mobility and
  ultimately benefiting the communities that rely on public transportation the most.
