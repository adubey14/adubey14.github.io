abstract: We introduced the modeling paradigm of Temporal Causal Diagrams (TCD) in
  this paper. TCDs capture fault propagation and behavior (nominal and faulty) of
  system components. An example model for the power transmission systems was also
  described. This TCD model was then used to develop an executable simulation model
  in Simulink/ Stateflow. Though this translation of TCD to an executable model is
  currently done manually, we are developing model templates and tools to automate
  this process. Simulations results (i.e., event traces) for a couple of single and
  multi-fault scenarios were also presented. As part of our future work, we wish to
  test and study the scalability of this approach towards a larger power transmission
  system taking into account a far richer set of protection elements. Further, we
  wish to consider more realistic event traces from the fault scenarios including
  missing, inconsistent and out-of-sequence alarms and events.
