abstract: Route Planning Systems (RPS) are a core component of autonomous personal
  transport systems essential for safe and efficient navigation of dynamic urban environments
  with the support of edge-based smart city infrastructure, but they also raise concerns
  about user route privacy in the context of both privately owned and commercial vehicles.
  Numerous high-profile data breaches in recent years have fortunately motivated research
  on privacy-preserving RPS, but most of them are rendered impractical by greatly
  increased communication and processing overhead. We address this by proposing an
  approach called Hierarchical Privacy-Preserving Route Planning (HPRoP), which divides
  and distributes the route-planning task across multiple levels and protects locations
  along the entire route. This is done by combining Inertial Flow partitioning, Private
  Information Retrieval (PIR), and Edge Computing techniques with our novel route-planning
  heuristic algorithm. Normalized metrics were also formulated to quantify the privacy
  of the source/destination points (endpoint location privacy) and the route itself
  (route privacy). Evaluation on a simulated road network showed that HPRoP reliably
  produces routes differing only by ≤ 20% in length from optimal shortest paths, with
  completion times within ∼ 25 seconds, which is reasonable for a PIR-based approach.
  On top of this, more than half of the produced routes achieved near-optimal endpoint
  location privacy (∼ 1.0) and good route privacy (≥ 0.8).
