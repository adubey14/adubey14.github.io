abstract: Due to increasing concerns about environmental impact, operating costs,
  and energy security, public transit agencies are seeking to reduce their fuel use
  by employing electric vehicles (EVs). However, because of the high upfront cost
  of EVs, most agencies can afford only mixed fleets of internal-combustion and electric
  vehicles. Making the best use of these mixed fleets presents a challenge for agencies
  since optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging,
  etc. require accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in
  sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and machine learning enable remedying
  this situation; however, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no framework
  that would integrate all relevant data into a route-level prediction model for public
  transit. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the data-driven prediction
  of route-level energy use for mixed-vehicle transit fleets, which we evaluate using
  data collected from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit authority of Chattanooga,
  TN. We present a data collection and storage framework, which we use to capture
  system-level data, including traffic and weather conditions, and high-frequency
  vehicle-level data, including location traces, fuel or electricity use, etc. We
  present domain-specific methods and algorithms for integrating and cleansing data
  from various sources, including street and elevation maps. Finally, we train and
  evaluate machine learning models, including deep neural networks, decision trees,
  and linear regression, on our integrated dataset. Our results show that neural networks
  provide accurate estimates, while other models can help us discover relations between
  energy use and factors such as road and weather conditions.
