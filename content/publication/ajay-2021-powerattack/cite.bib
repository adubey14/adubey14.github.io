 abstract = {Due to the increased deployment of novel  communication, control and protection functions, the grid has become vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Designing robust machine learning based attack detection and mitigation algorithms require large amounts of data that rely heavily on a  representative environment, where different attacks can be simulated. This paper presents a comprehensive tool-chain for modeling and simulating attacks in power systems. The paper makes the following contributions, first, we present a probabilistic domain specific language to define multiple attack scenarios and simulation configuration parameters. Secondly, we extend the PyPower-dynamics simulator with protection system components to simulate cyber attacks in control and protection layers of power system. In the end, we demonstrate multiple attack scenarios with a case study based on IEEE 39 bus system.},
