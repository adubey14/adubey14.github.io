abstract: 'Effective public transit operations are one of the fundamental requirements
  for a modern community. Recently, a number of transit agencies have started integrating
  automated vehicle locators in their fleet, which provides a real-time estimate of
  the time of arrival. In this paper, we use the data collected over several months
  from one such transit system and show how this data can be potentially used to learn
  long term patterns of travel time. More specifically, we study the effect of weather
  and other factors such as traffic on the transit system delay. These models can
  later be used to understand the seasonal variations and to design adaptive and transient
  transit schedules. Towards this goal, we also propose an online architecture called
  DelayRadar. The novelty of DelayRadar lies in three aspects: (1) a data store that
  collects and integrates real-time and static data from multiple data sources, (2)
  a predictive statistical model that analyzes the data to make predictions on transit
  travel time, and (3) a decision making framework to develop an optimal transit schedule
  based on variable forecasts related to traffic, weather, and other impactful factors.
  This paper focuses on identifying the model with the best predictive accuracy to
  be used in DelayRadar. According to the preliminary study results, we are able to
  explain more than 70% of the variance in the bus travel time and we can make future
  travel predictions with an out-of-sample error of 4.8 minutes with information on
  the bus schedule, traffic, and weather.'
