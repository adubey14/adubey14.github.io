abstract: While on-demand ride-sharing services have become popular in recent years,
  traditional on-demand transit services cannot be used by everyone, e.g., people
  who use wheelchairs. Paratransit services, operated by public transit agencies,
  are a critical infrastructure that offers door-to-door transportation assistance
  for individuals who face challenges in using standard transit routes. However, with
  declining ridership and mounting financial pressure, public transit agencies in
  the USA struggle to operate existing services. We collaborate with a public transit
  agency from the southern USA, highlight the specific nuances of paratransit optimization,
  and present a vehicle routing problem formulation for optimizing paratransit. We
  validate our approach using real-world data from the transit agency, present results
  from an actual pilot deployment of the proposed approach in the city, and show how
  the proposed approach comprehensively outperforms existing approaches used by the
  transit agency. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents one of the first
  examples of using open-source algorithmic approaches for paratransit optimization.
