 abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are expected to perform tasks with ever-increasing levels of autonomy, often in highly uncertain environments. Traditional design techniques based on domain knowledge and analytical models are often unable to cope with epistemic uncertainties present in these systems. This challenge, combined with recent advances in machine learning, has led to the emergence of Learning-Enabled Components (LECs) in CPS. However, very little tool support is available for design automation of these systems. In this demonstration, we introduce an integrated toolchain for the development of CPS with LECs with support for architectural modeling, data collection, system software deployment, and LEC training, evaluation, and verification. Additionally, the toolchain supports the modeling and analysis of safety cases - a critical part of the engineering process for mission and safety critical systems.},
