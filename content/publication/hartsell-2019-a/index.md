abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are expected to perform tasks with ever-increasing
  levels of autonomy, often in highly uncertain environments. Traditional design techniques
  based on domain knowledge and analytical models are often unable to cope with epistemic
  uncertainties present in these systems. This challenge, combined with recent advances
  in machine learning, has led to the emergence of Learning-Enabled Components (LECs)
  in CPS. However, very little tool support is available for design automation of
  these systems. In this demonstration, we introduce an integrated toolchain for the
  development of CPS with LECs with support for architectural modeling, data collection,
  system software deployment, and LEC training, evaluation, and verification. Additionally,
  the toolchain supports the modeling and analysis of safety cases - a critical part
  of the engineering process for mission and safety critical systems.
