 abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) are ideally suited for distributed control solutions. However, implementation and validation of the developed distributed control algorithms are quite challenging. In this paper we propose a Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL) platform for MG distributed control applications that satisfy the requirements of IEEE Std. 2030.7 for MG control systems. We describe two main features of the proposed platform: 1) a software platform that enables the implementation of control algorithms that have been developed analytically and 2) a real-time MG testbed that replicates practical MG operation environment by using real-time communication network and grid solutions. Implementation and validation of a distributed MG synchronization operation control strategy are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed CHIL platform.},
