abstract: 'Microgrids (MGs) are ideally suited for distributed control solutions.
  However, implementation and validation of the developed distributed control algorithms
  are quite challenging. In this paper we propose a Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop
  (CHIL) platform for MG distributed control applications that satisfy the requirements
  of IEEE Std. 2030.7 for MG control systems. We describe two main features of the
  proposed platform: 1) a software platform that enables the implementation of control
  algorithms that have been developed analytically and 2) a real-time MG testbed that
  replicates practical MG operation environment by using real-time communication network
  and grid solutions. Implementation and validation of a distributed MG synchronization
  operation control strategy are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
  CHIL platform.'
