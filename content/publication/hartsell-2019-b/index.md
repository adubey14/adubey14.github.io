abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are used in many applications where they must
  perform complex tasks with a high degree of autonomy in uncertain environments.
  Traditional design flows based on domain knowledge and analytical models are often
  impractical for tasks such as perception, planning in uncertain environments, control
  with ill-defined objectives, etc. Machine learning based techniques have demonstrated
  good performance for such difficult tasks, leading to the introduction of Learning-Enabled
  Components (LEC) in CPS. Model based design techniques have been successful in the
  development of traditional CPS, and toolchains which apply these techniques to CPS
  with LECs are being actively developed. As LECs are critically dependent on training
  and data, one of the key challenges is to build design automation for them. In this
  paper, we examine the development of an autonomous Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV)
  using the Assurance-based Learning-enabled Cyber-physical systems (ALC) Toolchain.
  Each stage of the development cycle is described including architectural modeling,
  data collection, LEC training, LEC evaluation and verification, and system-level
  assurance.
