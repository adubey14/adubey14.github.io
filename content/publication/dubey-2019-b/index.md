abstract: The focus of this workshop is the integrated insights into internet of things,
  behavioral/social sciences research and data analytics in the performance of urban
  services, facilities, and infrastructure of smart and connected communities. This
  is important because communities today are dealing with a number of stresses whose
  outcomes will ultimately decide the ability to maintain a sustainable and resilient
  future. This is particularly true of urban environments; their explosive growth
  is one of the most exciting, yet complex problems of this century. Against this
  backdrop is the emergence of technologies, both hard and soft, that offer the potential
  to provide a more intelligent approach to establishing and maintaining livable communities.
  Smart sensors (e.g., cameras, air quality monitors, geographic positioning) are
  now embedded in almost every physical device and system we use. This information
  is being utilized by new modes of networking, algorithms for high-resolution data-driven
  analysis, and paradigms of distributed computing to perform complex data analytics
  in support of a safe, secure, efficient, and productive environment.
