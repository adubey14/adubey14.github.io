 abstract = {The focus of this workshop is the integrated insights into internet of things, behavioral/social sciences research and data analytics in the performance of urban services, facilities, and infrastructure of smart and connected communities. This is important because communities today are dealing with a number of stresses whose outcomes will ultimately decide the ability to maintain a sustainable and resilient future. This is particularly true of urban environments; their explosive growth is one of the most exciting, yet complex problems of this century. Against this backdrop is the emergence of technologies, both hard and soft, that offer the potential to provide a more intelligent approach to establishing and maintaining livable communities. Smart sensors (e.g., cameras, air quality monitors, geographic positioning) are now embedded in almost every physical device and system we use. This information is being utilized by new modes of networking, algorithms for high-resolution data-driven analysis, and paradigms of distributed computing to perform complex data analytics in support of a safe, secure, efficient, and productive environment.},
