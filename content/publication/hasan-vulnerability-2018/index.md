abstract: Reliable operation of power systems is a primary challenge for the system
  operators. With the advancement in technology and grid automation, power systems
  are becoming more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The main goal of adversaries is to
  take advantage of these vulnerabilities and destabilize the system. This paper describes
  a game-theoretic approach to attacker / defender modeling in power systems. In our
  models, the attacker can strategically identify the subset of substations that maximize
  damage when compromised. However, the defender can identify the critical subset
  of substations to protect in order to minimize the damage when an attacker launches
  a cyber-attack. The algorithms for these models are applied to the standard IEEE-14,
  39, and 57 bus examples to identify the critical set of substations given an attacker
  and a defender budget.
