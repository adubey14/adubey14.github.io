abstract: 'Abstract Due to the ever-increasing adaptation of Blockchain technologies
  in the private, public, and business domains, both the use of Distributed Systems
  and the increased demand for their reliability has exploded recently, especially
  with their desired integration with Internet-of-Things devices. This has resulted
  in a lot of work being done in the fields of distributed system analysis and design,
  specifically in the areas of blockchain smart contract design and formal verification.
  However, the focus on formal verification methodologies has meant that less attention
  has been given toward more traditional testing methodologies, such as unit testing
  and integration testing. This includes a lack of full support by most, if not all,
  the major blockchain implementations for testing at scale, except on fully public
  test networks. This has several drawbacks, such as: (1) The inability to do repeatable
  testing under identical scenarios, (2) reliance upon public mining of blocks, which
  introduces unreasonable amounts of delay for a test driven development scenario
  that a private network could reduce or eliminate, and (3) the inability to design
  scenarios where parts of the network go down. In this chapter we discuss design,
  testing methodologies, and tools to allow Testing at Scale of IoT Blockchain Applications.'
