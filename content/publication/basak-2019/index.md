abstract: 'Bus transit systems are the backbone of public transportation in the United
  States. An important indicator of the quality of service in such infrastructures
  is on-time performance at stops, with published transit schedules playing an integral
  role governing the level of success of the service. However there are relatively
  few optimization architectures leveraging stochastic search that focus on optimizing
  bus timetables with the objective of maximizing probability of bus arrivals at timepoints
  with delays within desired on-time ranges. In addition to this, there is a lack
  of substantial research considering monthly and seasonal variations of delay patterns
  integrated with such optimization strategies. To address these, this paper makes
  the following contributions to the corpus of studies on transit on-time performance
  optimization: (a) an unsupervised clustering mechanism is presented which groups
  months with similar seasonal delay patterns, (b) the problem is formulated as a
  single-objective optimization task and a greedy algorithm, a genetic algorithm (GA)
  as well as a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are employed to solve it,
  (c) a detailed discussion on empirical results comparing the algorithms are provided
  and sensitivity analysis on hyper-parameters of the heuristics are presented along
  with execution times, which will help practitioners looking at similar problems.
  The analyses conducted are insightful in the local context of improving public transit
  scheduling in the Nashville metro region as well as informative from a global perspective
  as an elaborate case study which builds upon the growing corpus of empirical studies
  using nature-inspired approaches to transit schedule optimization.'
