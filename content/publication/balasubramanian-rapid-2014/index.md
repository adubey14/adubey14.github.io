abstract: "Mobile clouds such as network-connected vehicles and satellite clusters
  are an emerging class of systems that are extensions to traditional real-time embedded
  systems: they provide long-term mission platforms made up of dynamic clusters of
  heterogeneous hardware nodes communicating over ad hoc wireless networks. Besides
  the inherent complexities entailed by a distributed architecture, developing software
  and testing these systems is difficult due to a number of other reasons, including
  the mobile nature of such systems, which can require a model of the physical dynamics
  of the system for accurate simulation and testing. This paper describes a rapid
  development and testing framework for a distributed satellite system. Our solutions
  include a modeling language for configuring and specifying an application's interaction
  with the middleware layer, a physics simulator integrated with hardware in the loop
  to provide the system's physical dynamics and the integration of a network traffic
  tool to dynamically vary the network bandwidth based on the physical dynamics."
