abstract: The Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) involves optimizing
  routes for vehicles to meet pickup and delivery requests within specific time constraints,
  a challenge commonly faced in logistics and transportation. Microtransit, a flexible
  and demand-responsive service using smaller vehicles within defined zones, can be
  effectively modeled as a PDPTW. Yet, the need for driver breaks—a key human constraint—is
  frequently overlooked in PDPTW solutions, despite being necessary for regulatory
  compliance. This study presents a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation
  for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Driver Breaks (PDPTW-DB).
  To the best of our knowledge this formulation is the first to consider mandatory
  periodic driver breaks within optimized Microtransit routes. The proposed model
  incorporates regulatory compliant break scheduling directly within the vehicle routing
  optimization framework. By considering driver break requirements as an integral
  component of the optimization process, rather than as a post-processing step, the
  model enables the generation of routes that respect hours of service regulations
  while minimizing operational costs. This integrated approach facilitates the generation
  of schedules that are operationally efficient and prioritize driver welfare through
  driver breaks. We work with a public transit agency from the southern USA, and highlight
  the specific nuances of driver break optimization, and present a Pickup and Delivery
  Problem with Time Windows formulation for optimizing Microtransit operations and
  scheduling driver breaks. We validate our approach using real-world data from the
  transit agency. Our results validate our formulation in producing cost-effective,
  and regulation-compliant solutions.
