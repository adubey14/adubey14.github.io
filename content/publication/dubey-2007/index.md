abstract: Designing autonomic fault responses is difficult, particularly in large-scale
  systems, as there is no single textquoteleftperfecttextquoteright fault mitigation
  response to a given failure. The design of appropriate mitigation actions depend
  upon the goals and state of the application and environment. Strict time deadlines
  in real-time systems further exacerbate this problem. Any autonomic behavior in
  such systems must not only be functionally correct but should also conform to properties
  of liveness, safety and bounded time responsiveness. This paper details a real-time
  fault-tolerant framework, which uses a reflex and healing architecture to provide
  fault mitigation capabilities for large-scale real-time systems. At the heart of
  this architecture is a real-time reflex engine, which has a state-based failure
  management logic that can respond to both event- and time-based triggers. We also
  present a semantic domain for verifying properties of systems, which use this framework
  of real-time reflex engines. Lastly, a case study, which examines the details of
  such an approach, is presented.
