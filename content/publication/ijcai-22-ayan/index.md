abstract: "More than 5 million children under five years die from largely preventable\
  \ or treatable medical conditions every year, with an overwhelmingly large proportion\
  \ of deaths occurring in under-developed countries with low vaccination uptake.\
  \ One of the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDG 3) aims to end preventable\
  \ deaths of newborns and children under five years of age. We focus on Nigeria,\
  \ where the rate of infant mortality is appalling. We collaborate with HelpMum,\
  \ a large non-profit organization in Nigeria to design and optimize the allocation\
  \ of heterogeneous health interventions under uncertainty to increase vaccination\
  \ uptake, the first such collaboration in Nigeria. Our framework, ADVISER: AI-Driven\
  \ Vaccination Intervention Optimiser, is based on an integer linear program that\
  \ seeks to maximize the cumulative probability of successful vaccination. Our optimization\
  \ formulation is intractable in practice. We present a heuristic approach that enables\
  \ us to solve the problem for real-world use-cases. We also present theoretical\
  \ bounds for the heuristic method. Finally, we show that the proposed approach outperforms\
  \ baseline methods in terms of vaccination uptake through experimental evaluation.\
  \ HelpMum is currently planning a pilot program based on our approach to be deployed\
  \ in the largest city of Nigeria, which would be the first deployment of an AIdriven\
  \ vaccination uptake program in the country and hopefully, pave the way for other\
  \ data-driven programs to improve health outcomes in Nigeria."
