abstract: "More than 5 million children under five years die from largely preventable
  or treatable medical conditions every year, with an overwhelmingly large proportion
  of deaths occurring in under-developed countries with low vaccination uptake. One
  of the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDG 3) aims to end preventable
  deaths of newborns and children under five years of age. We focus on Nigeria, where
  the rate of infant mortality is appalling. We collaborate with HelpMum, a large
  non-profit organization in Nigeria to design and optimize the allocation of heterogeneous
  health interventions under uncertainty to increase vaccination uptake, the first
  such collaboration in Nigeria. Our framework, ADVISER: AI-Driven Vaccination Intervention
  Optimiser, is based on an integer linear program that seeks to maximize the cumulative
  probability of successful vaccination. Our optimization formulation is intractable
  in practice. We present a heuristic approach that enables us to solve the problem
  for real-world use-cases. We also present theoretical bounds for the heuristic method.
  Finally, we show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in terms
  of vaccination uptake through experimental evaluation. HelpMum is currently planning
  a pilot program based on our approach to be deployed in the largest city of Nigeria,
  which would be the first deployment of an AIdriven vaccination uptake program in
  the country and hopefully, pave the way for other data-driven programs to improve
  health outcomes in Nigeria."
