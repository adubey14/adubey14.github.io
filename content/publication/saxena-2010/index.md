abstract: Reconfiguration and self-management are important properties for systems
  that operate in hazardous and uncontrolled environments, such as inter-planetary
  space. These systems need a reconfiguration mechanism that provides recovery from
  individual component failures as well as the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving
  mission goals. One way to provide this functionality is to define a model of alternative
  system configurations and allow the system to choose the current configuration based
  on its current state, including environmental parameters and goals. The primary
  difficulties with this approach are (1) the state space of configurations can grow
  very large, which can make explicit enumeration infeasible, and (2) the component
  failures and evolving system goals must be somehow encoded in the system configuration
  model. This paper describes an online reconfiguration method based on model-based
  designspace exploration. We symbolically encode the set of valid system configurations
  and assert the current system state and goals as symbolic constraints. Our initial
  work indicates that this method scales and is capable of providing effective online
  dynamic reconfiguration.
