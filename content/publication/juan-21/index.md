abstract: Public transit agencies struggle to maintain transit accessibility with
  reduced resources, unreliable ridership data, reduced vehicle capacities due to
  social distancing, and reduced services due to driver unavailability. In collaboration
  with transit agencies from two large metropolitan areas in the USA, we are designing
  novel approaches for addressing the afore-mentioned challenges by collecting accurate
  real-time ridership data, providing guidance to commuters, and performing operational
  optimization for public transit. We estimate rider-ship data using historical automated
  passenger counting data, conditional on a set of relevant determinants. Accurate
  ridership forecasting is essential to optimize the public transit schedule,  which
  is necessary to improve current fixed lines with on-demand transit. Also, passenger
  crowding has been a problem for public transportation since it deteriorates passengers'
  wellbeing and satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, passenger crowding has
  gained importance since it represents a  risk for social distancing violations.
  Therefore, we are creating optimization models to ensure that social distancing
  norms can be adequately followed while ensuring that the total demand for transit
  is met. We will then use accurate forecasts for operational optimization that includes
  textit(a) proactive fixed-line schedule optimization based on predicted demand,
  textit(b) dispatch of on-demand micro-transit, prioritizing at-risk populations,
  and textit(c) allocation of vehicles to transit and cargo trips, considering exigent
  vehicle maintenance requirements (textiti.e., disinfection). Finally, this paper
  presents some initial results from our project regarding the estimation of ridership
  in public transit.
