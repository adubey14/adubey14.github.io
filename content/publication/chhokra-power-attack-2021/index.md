abstract: Due to the increased deployment of novel communication, control and protection
  functions, the grid has become vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Designing robust
  machine learning based attack detection and mitigation algorithms require large
  amounts of data that rely heavily on a representative environment, where different
  attacks can be simulated. This paper presents a comprehensive tool-chain for modeling
  and simulating attacks in power systems. The paper makes the following contributions,
  first, we present a probabilistic domain specific language to define multiple attack
  scenarios and simulation configuration parameters. Secondly, we extend the PyPower-dynamics
  simulator with protection system components to simulate cyber attacks in control
  and protection layers of power system. In the end, we demonstrate multiple attack
  scenarios with a case study based on IEEE 39 bus system.
