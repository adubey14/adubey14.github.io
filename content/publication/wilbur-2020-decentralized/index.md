abstract: Recent advancements in cloud computing have driven rapid development in
  data-intensive smart city applications by providing near real time processing and
  storage scalability. This has resulted in efficient centralized route planning services
  such as Google Maps, upon which millions of users rely. Route planning algorithms
  have progressed in line with the cloud environments in which they run. Current state
  of the art solutions assume a shared memory model, hence deployment is limited to
  multiprocessing environments in data centers. By centralizing these services, latency
  has become the limiting parameter in the technologies of the future, such as autonomous
  cars. Additionally, these services require access to outside networks, raising availability
  concerns in disaster scenarios. Therefore, this paper provides a decentralized route
  planning approach for private fog networks. We leverage recent advances in federated
  learning to collaboratively learn shared prediction models online and investigate
  our approach with a simulated case study from a mid-size U.S. city.
