abstract: Large scientific computing clusters require a distributed dependability
  subsystem that can provide fault isolation and recovery and is capable of learning
  and predicting failures, to improve the reliability of scientific workflows. In
  this paper, we outline the key ideas in the design of a Scientific Computing Autonomic
  Reliability Framework (SCARF) for large computing clusters used in the Lattice Quantum
  Chromo Dynamics project at Fermi Lab.
