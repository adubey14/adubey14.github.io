abstract: In this paper, we describe the design of a scientific workflow execution
  framework that integrates runtime verification to monitor its execution and checking
  it against the formal specifications. For controlling workflow execution, this framework
  provides for data provenance, execution tracking and online monitoring of each work
  flow task, also referred to as participants. The sequence of participants is described
  in an abstract parameterized view, which is used to generate concrete data dependency
  based sequence of participants with defined arguments. As participants belonging
  to a workflow are mapped onto machines and executed, periodic and on-demand monitoring
  of vital health parameters on allocated nodes is enabled according to pre-specified
  invariant conditions with actions to be taken upon violation of invariants.
