abstract: Resiliency and reliability is of paramount impor- tance for energy cyber
  physical systems. Electrical protection systems including detection elements such
  as Distance Relays and actuation elements such as Breakers are designed to protect
  the system from abnormal operations and arrest failure propagation by rapidly isolating
  the faulty components. However, failure in the protection devices themselves can
  and do lead to major system events and fault cascades, often leading to blackouts.
  This paper augments our past work on Temporal Causal Diagrams (TCD), a modeling
  formalism designed to help reason about the failure progressions by (a) describing
  a way to generate the TCD model from the system specification, and (b) understand
  the system failure dynamics for TCD reasoners by configuring simulation models.
