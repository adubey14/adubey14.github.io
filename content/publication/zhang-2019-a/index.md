abstract: Transactive energy systems (TES) are emerging as a transformative solution
  for the problems that distribution system operators face due to an increase in the
  use of distributed energy resources and rapid growth in scalability of managing
  active distribution system (ADS). On the one hand, these changes pose a decentralized
  power system control problem, requiring strategic control to maintain reliability
  and resiliency for the community and for the utility. On the other hand, they require
  robust financial markets while allowing participation from diverse prosumers. To
  support the computing and flexibility requirements of TES while preserving privacy
  and security, distributed software platforms are required. In this paper, we enable
  the study and analysis of security concerns by developing Transactive Energy Security
  Simulation Testbed (TESST), a TES testbed for simulating various cyber attacks.
  In this work, the testbed is used for TES simulation with centralized clearing market,
  highlighting weaknesses in a centralized system. Additionally, we present a blockchain
  enabled decentralized market solution supported by distributed computing for TES,
  which on one hand can alleviate some of the problems that we identify, but on the
  other hand, may introduce newer issues. Future study of these differing paradigms
  is necessary and will continue as we develop our security simulation testbed.
