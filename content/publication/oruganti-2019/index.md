abstract: An effective real-time estimation of the travel time for vehicles, using
  AVL(Automatic Vehicle Locators) has added a new dimension to the smart city planning.
  In this paper, we used data collected over several months from a transit agency
  and show how this data can be potentially used to learn patterns of travel time
  during specially planned events like NFL (National Football League) games and music
  award ceremonies. The impact of NFL games along with consideration of other factors
  like weather, traffic condition, distance is discussed with their relative importance
  to the prediction of travel time. Statistical learning models are used to predict
  travel time and subsequently assess the cascading effects of delay. The model performance
  is determined based on its predictive accuracy according to the out-of-sample error.
  In addition, the models help identify the most significant variables that influence
  the delay in the transit system. In order to compare the actual and predicted travel
  time for days having special events, heat maps are generated showing the delay impacts
  in different time windows between two timepoint-segments in comparison to a non-game
  day. This work focuses on the prediction and visualization of the delay in the public
  transit system and the analysis of its cascading effects on the entire transportation
  network.  According to the study results, we are able to explain more than 80% of
  the variance in the bus travel time at each segment and can make future travel predictions
  during planned events with an out-of-sample error of 2.0 minutes using information
  on the bus schedule, traffic, weather, and scheduled events. According to the variable
  importance analysis, traffic information is most significant in predicting the delay
  in the transit system.
