abstract: Public transit is central to cultivating equitable communities. Meanwhile,
  the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically
  transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect
  of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups
  are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on
  public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing
  adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment.
  Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted
  ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied
  spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven
  analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal
  variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership
  decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups.
  We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped
  by 66.9% and 65.1% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines
  respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time.
  Additionally, there was a significant difference in ridership decline between the
  highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77% vs 58%) in Nashville.
