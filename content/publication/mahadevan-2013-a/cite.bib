 abstract = {Rising software complexity in aerospace systems makes them very dicult to analyze and prepare for all possible fault scenarios at design-time. Therefore, classical run-time fault-tolerance techniques, such as self-checking pairs and triple modular redundancy are used. However, several recent incidents have made it clear that existing software fault tolerance techniques alone are not sucient. To improve system dependability, simpler, yet formally specied and veried run-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault mitigation are needed. Such architectures are already in use for managing the health of vehicles and systems. Software health management is the application of adapting and applying these techniques to software. In this paper, we briey describe the software health management technique and architecture developed by our research group. The foundation of the architecture is a real-time component framework (built upon ARINC-653 platform services) that denes a model of computation for software components. Dedicated architectural elements: the Component Level Health Manager (CLHM) and System Level Health Manager (SLHM) are providing health management services: anomaly detection, fault source isolation, and fault mitigation. The SLHM includes a diagnosis engine that uses a Timed Failure Propagation (TFPG) model derived from the component assembly model, and it reasons about cascading fault eects in the system and isolates the fault source component(s). Thereafter, the appropriate system level mitigation action is taken. The main focus of this article is the description of the fault mitigation architecture that uses goal-based deliberative reasoning to determine the best mitigation actions for recovering the system from the identied failure mode.},
