abstract: Due to increase in number and complexity of the large scale systems, performance
  monitoring and multidimensional quality of service (QoS) management has become a
  difficult and error prone task for system administrators. Recently, the trend has
  been to use virtualization technology, which facilitates hosting of multiple distributed
  systems with minimum infrastructure cost via sharing of computational and memory
  resources among multiple instances, and allows dynamic creation of even bigger clusters.
  An effective monitoring technique should not only be fine grained with respect to
  the measured variables, but also should be able to provide a high level overview
  of the distributed systems to the administrator of all variables that can affect
  the QoS requirements. At the same time, the technique should not add performance
  burden to the system. Finally, it should be integrated with a control methodology
  that manages performance of the enterprise system. In this paper, a systematic distributed
  event based (DEB) performance monitoring approach is presented for distributed systems
  by measuring system variables (physical/virtual CPU utilization and memory utilization),
  application variables (application queue size, queue waiting time, and service time),
  and performance variables (response time, throughput, and power consumption) accurately
  with minimum latency at a specified rate. Furthermore, we have shown that proposed
  monitoring approach can be utilized to provide input to an application monitoring
  utility to understand the underlying performance model of the system for a successful
  on-line control of the distributed systems for achieving predefined QoS parameters.
