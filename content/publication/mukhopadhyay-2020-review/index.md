abstract: Emergency response to incidents such as roadway accidents is one of the
  most pressing problems faced by communities across the globe. In the last fifty
  years, researchers have developed statistical, analytical, and algorithmic approaches
  for designing emergency response management (ERM) systems. In this survey, we present
  models for incident prediction, resource allocation, and dispatch concerning urban
  emergency incidents like roadway accidents and crashes. We highlight the strengths
  and weaknesses of prior work in this domain and explore the similarities and differences
  between different incident types. Finally, we present future research directions.
  To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive survey that explores
  the entirety of ERM systems.
