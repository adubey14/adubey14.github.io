abstract: The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable
  transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public
  transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of
  both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational chal- lenges. One major
  challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary
  throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response
  to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints.
  This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model
  to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments
  for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic
  electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential
  computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with
  relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet
  composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA,
  we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs
  of the mixed transit fleets.
