abstract: While there are many advantages to electric public transit vehicles, they
  also pose new challenges for fleet operators. One key challenge is defining a charge
  scheduling policy that minimizes operating costs and power grid disruptions while
  maintaining schedule adherence. An uncoordinated policy could result in buses running
  out of charge before completing their trip, while a grid agnostic policy might incur
  higher energy costs or cause an adverse impact on the grid’s distribution system.
  We present a grid aware decision-theoretic framework for electric bus charge scheduling
  that accounts for energy price and grid load. The framework co-simulates models
  for traffic (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and the electric grid (GridLAB-D), which
  are used by a decision-theoretic planner to evaluate charging decisions with regard
  to their long-term effect on grid reliability and cost. We evaluated the framework
  on a simulation of Richland, WA’s bus and grid network, and found that it could
  save over $100k per year on operating costs for the city compared to greedy methods.
