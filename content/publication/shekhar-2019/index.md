abstract: The fog/edge computing paradigm is increasingly being adopted to support
  a variety of latency-sensitive IoT services, such as cognitive assistance to the
  visually impaired, due to its ability to assure the latency requirements of these
  services while continuing to benefit from the elastic properties of cloud computing.
  However, user mobility in such applications imposes a new set of challenges that
  must be addressed before such applications can be deployed and benefit the society.
  This paper presents ongoing work on a dynamic resource management middleware called
  URMILA that addresses these concerns. URMILA ensures that the service remains available
  despite user mobility and ensuing wireless connectivity issues by opportunistically
  leveraging both fog and edge resources in such a way that the latency requirements
  of the service are met while ensuring longevity of the battery life on the edge
  devices. We present the design principles of URMILA's capabilities and a real-world
  cognitive assistance application that we have built and are testing on an emulated
  but realistic IoT testbed.
