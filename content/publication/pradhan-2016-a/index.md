abstract: 'The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving several technological
  trends. The first trend is an increased level of integration between edge devices
  and commodity computers. This trend, in conjunction with low power-devices, energy
  harvesting, and improved battery technology, is enabling the next generation of
  information technology (IT) innovation: city-scale smart systems. These types of
  IoT systems can operate at multiple time-scales, ranging from closed-loop control
  requiring strict real-time decision and actuation to near real-time operation with
  humans-in-the-loop, as well as to long-term analysis, planning, and decision-making.'
