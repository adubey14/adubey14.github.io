 abstract = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving several technological trends. The first trend is an increased level of integration between edge devices and commodity computers. This trend, in conjunction with low power-devices, energy harvesting, and improved battery technology, is enabling the next generation of information technology (IT) innovation: city-scale smart systems. These types of IoT systems can operate at multiple time-scales, ranging from closed-loop control requiring strict real-time decision and actuation to near real-time operation with humans-in-the-loop, as well as to long-term analysis, planning, and decision-making.},
