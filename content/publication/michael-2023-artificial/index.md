abstract: There are more than 7,000 public transit agencies in the U.S. (and many
  more private agencies), and together, they are responsible for serving 60 billion
  passenger miles each year. A well-functioning transit system fosters the growth
  and expansion of businesses, distributes social and economic benefits, and links
  the capabilities of community members, thereby enhancing what they can accomplish
  as a society. Since affordable public transit services are the backbones of many
  communities, this work investigates ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) can
  improve efficiency and increase utilization from the perspective of transit agencies.
  This book chapter discusses the primary requirements, objectives, and challenges
  related to the design of AI-driven smart transportation systems. We focus on three
  major topics. First, we discuss data sources and data. Second, we provide an overview
  of how AI can aid decision-making with a focus on transportation. Lastly, we discuss
  computational problems in the transportation domain and AI approaches to these problems.
