abstract: Public bus transit plays an important role in city transportation infrastructure.
  However, public bus transit is often difficult to use because of lack of real- time
  information about bus locations and delay time, which in the presence of operational
  delays and service alerts makes it difficult for riders to predict when buses will
  arrive and plan trips. Precisely tracking vehicle and informing riders of estimated
  times of arrival is challenging due to a number of factors, such as traffic congestion,
  operational delays, varying times taken to load passengers at each stop. In this
  paper, we introduce a public transportation decision support system for both short-term
  as well as long-term prediction of arrival bus times. The system uses streaming
  real-time bus position data, which is updated once every minute, and historical
  arrival and departure data - available for select stops to predict bus arrival times.
  Our approach combines clustering analysis and Kalman filters with a shared route
  segment model in order to produce more accurate arrival time predictions. Experiments
  show that compared to the basic arrival time prediction model that is currently
  being used by the city, our system reduces arrival time prediction errors by 25
  percent on average when predicting the arrival delay an hour ahead and 47 percent
  when predicting within a 15 minute future time window.
