abstract: The complexity of software in systems like aerospace vehicles has reached
  the point where new techniques are needed to ensure system dependability. Such techniques
  include a novel direction called ‘Software Health Management’ (SHM) that extends
  classic software fault tolerance with techniques borrowed from System Health Management.
  In this paper the initial steps towards building a SHM approach are described that
  combine component-based software construction with hard real-time operating system
  platforms. Specifically, the paper discusses how the CORBA Component Model could
  be combined with the ARINC-653 platform services and the lessons learned from this
  experiment. The results point towards both extending the CCM as well as revising
  the ARINC-653
