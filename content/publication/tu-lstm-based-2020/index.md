abstract: Accurate prediction of electric load is critical to optimally controlling
  and operating buildings. It provides the opportunities to reduce building energy
  consumption and to implement advanced functionalities such as demand response in
  the context of smart grid. However, buildings are nonstationary and it is important
  to consider the underlying concept changes that will affect the load pattern. In
  this paper we present an online learning method for predicting building electric
  load during concept changes such as COVID-19. The proposed methods is based on online
  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. To speed up the learning
  process during concept changes and improve prediction accuracy, an ensemble of multiple
  models with different learning rates is used. The learning rates are updated in
  realtime to best adapt to the new concept while maintaining the learned information
  for the prediction.
