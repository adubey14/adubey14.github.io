abstract: The growing complexity of software used in large-scale, safety critical
  cyber-physical systems makes it increasingly difficult to expose and hence correct
  all potential defects. There is a need to augment the existing fault tolerance methodologies
  with new approaches that address latent software defects exposed at runtime. This
  paper describes an approach that borrows and adapts traditional textquoteleftSystem
  Health Managementtextquoteright techniques to improve software dependability through
  simple formal specification of runtime monitoring, diagnosis, and mitigation strategies.
  The two-level approach to health management at the component and system level is
  demonstrated on a simulated case study of an Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU).
  An ADIRU was categorized as the primary failure source for the in-flight upset caused
  in the Malaysian Air flight 124 over Perth, Australia in 2005.
