abstract: The vision of the ‘Smart Grid’ anticipates a distributed real-time embedded
  system that implements various monitoring and control functions. As the reliability
  of the power grid is critical to modern society, the software supporting the grid
  must support fault tolerance and resilience of the resulting cyber-physical system.
  This paper describes the fault-tolerance features of a software framework called
  Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid (RIAPS). The framework
  supports various mechanisms for fault detection and mitigation and works in concert
  with the applications that implement the grid-specific functions. The paper discusses
  the design philosophy for and the implementation of the fault tolerance features
  and presents an application example to show how it can be used to build highly resilient
  systems.
