abstract: Modeling fire spread is critical in fire risk management. Creating data-driven
  models to forecast spread remains challenging due to the lack of comprehensive data
  sources that relate fires with relevant covariates. We present the first comprehensive
  and open-source dataset that relates historical fire data with relevant covariates
  such as weather, vegetation, and topography. Our dataset, named textitWildfireDB,
  contains over 17 million data points that capture how fires spread in the continental
  USA in the last decade. In this paper, we describe the algorithmic approach used
  to create and integrate the data, describe the dataset, and present benchmark results
  regarding data-driven models that can be learned to forecast the spread of wildfires.
