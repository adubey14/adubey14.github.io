 abstract = {Complexity in embedded software systems has reached the point where we need run-time mechanisms that provide fault management services. Testing and verification may not cover all possible scenarios that a system encounters, hence a simpler, yet formally specified run-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault mitigation architecture is needed to increase the software system's dependability. The approach described in this paper borrows concepts and principles from the field of `Systems Health Management' for complex aerospace systems and implements a novel two level health management architecture that can be applied in the context of a model-based software development process.},
