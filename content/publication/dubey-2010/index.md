abstract: Complexity in embedded software systems has reached the point where we need
  run-time mechanisms that provide fault management services. Testing and verification
  may not cover all possible scenarios that a system encounters, hence a simpler,
  yet formally specified run-time monitoring, diagnosis, and fault mitigation architecture
  is needed to increase the software system's dependability. The approach described
  in this paper borrows concepts and principles from the field of `Systems Health
  Management' for complex aerospace systems and implements a novel two level health
  management architecture that can be applied in the context of a model-based software
  development process.
