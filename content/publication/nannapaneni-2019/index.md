abstract: This paper proposes a flexible rerouting strategy for the public transit
  to accommodate the spatio-temporal variation in the travel demand. Transit routes
  are typically static in nature, i.e., the buses serve well-defined routes; this
  results in people living in away from the bus routes choose alternate transit modes
  such as private automotive vehicles resulting in ever-increasing traffic congestion.
  In the flex-transit mode, we reroute the buses to accommodate high travel demand
  areas away from the static routes considering its spatio-temporal variation. We
  perform clustering to identify several flex stops; these are stops not on the static
  routes, but with high travel demand around them. We divide the bus stops on the
  static routes into critical and non-critical bus stops; critical bus stops refer
  to transfer points, where people change bus routes to reach their destinations.
  In the existing static scheduling process, some slack time is provided at the end
  of each trip to account for any travel delays. Thus, the additional travel time
  incurred due to taking flexible routes is constrained to be less than the available
  slack time. We use the percent increase in travel demand to analyze the effectiveness
  of the rerouting process. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using real-world
  travel data for Route 7 operated by the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority
  (MTA).
