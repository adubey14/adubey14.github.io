abstract: Component-based software development for real-time systems necessitates
  a well-defined textquoteleftcomponent modeltextquoteright that allows compositional
  analysis and reasoning about systems. Such a model defines what a component is,
  how it works, and how it interacts with other components. It is especially important
  for real-time systems to have such a component model, as many problems in these
  systems arise from poorly understood and analyzed component interactions. In this
  paper we describe a component model for hard real-time systems that relies on the
  services of an ARINC-653 compliant real-time operating system platform. The model
  provides high-level abstractions of component interactions, both for the synchronous
  and asynchronous case. We present a formalization of the component model in the
  form of timed transition traces. Such formalization is necessary to be able  to
  derive interesting system level properties such as fault propagation graphs from
  models of component assemblies. We provide a brief discussion about such system
  level fault propagation templates  for this component model.
