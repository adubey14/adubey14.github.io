abstract: Modern intelligent urban mobility applications are underpinned by large-scale,
  multivariate, spatiotemporal data streams. Working with this data presents unique
  challenges of data management, processing and presentation that is often overlooked
  by researchers. Therefore, in this work we present an integrated data management
  and processing framework for intelligent urban mobility systems currently in use
  by our partner transit agencies. We discuss the available data sources and outline
  our cloud-centric data management and stream processing architecture built upon
  open-source publish-subscribe and NoSQL data stores. We then describe our data-integrity
  monitoring methods. We then present a set of visualization dashboards designed for
  our transit agency partners. Lastly, we discuss how these tools are currently being
  used for AI-driven urban mobility applications that use these tools.
