abstract: Efficient path optimization for drones in search and rescue operations faces
  challenges, including limited visibility, time constraints, and complex information
  gathering in urban environments. We present a comprehensive approach to optimize
  UAV-based search and rescue operations in neighborhood areas, utilizing both a 3D
  AirSim-ROS2 simulator and a 2D simulator. The path planning problem is formulated
  as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and we propose a novel
  \"Shrinking POMCP\" approach to address time constraints. In the AirSim environment,
  we integrate our approach with a probabilistic world model for belief maintenance
  and a neurosymbolic navigator for obstacle avoidance. The 2D simulator employs surrogate
  ROS2 nodes with equivalent functionality. We compare trajectories generated by different
  approaches in the 2D simulator and evaluate performance across various belief types
  in the 3D AirSim-ROS simulator. Experimental results from both simulators demonstrate
  that our proposed shrinking POMCP solution achieves significant improvements in
  search times compared to alternative methods, showcasing its potential for enhancing
  the efficiency of UAV-assisted search and rescue operations.
