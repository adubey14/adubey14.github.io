abstract: 'A classical problem in city-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS) is resource
  allocation under uncertainty. Spatial-temporal allocation of resources is optimized
  to allocate electric scooters across urban areas, place charging stations for vehicles,
  and design efficient on-demand transit. Typically, such problems are modeled as
  Markov (or semi-Markov) decision processes. While online, offline, and decentralized
  methodologies have been used to tackle such problems, none of the approaches scale
  well for large-scale decision problems. We create a general approach to hierarchical
  planning that leverages structure in city-level CPS problems to tackle resource
  allocation under uncertainty. We use emergency response as a case study and show
  how a large resource allocation problem can be split into smaller problems. We then
  create a principled framework for solving the smaller problems and tackling the
  interaction between them. Finally, we use real-world data from a major metropolitan
  area in the United States to validate our approach. Our experiments show that the
  proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches used in the field of emergency
  response. '
