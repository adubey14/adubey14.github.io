abstract: The increasing rate of urbanization has added pressure on the already constrained
  transportation networks in our communities. Ride-sharing platforms such as Uber
  and Lyft are becoming a more commonplace, particularly in urban environments. While
  such services may be deemed more convenient than riding public transit due to their
  on-demand nature, reports show that they do not necessarily decrease the congestion
  in major cities. One of the key problems is that typically mobility decision support
  systems focus on individual utility and react only after congestion appears. In
  this paper, we propose socially considerate multi-modal routing algorithms that
  are proactive and consider, via predictions, the shared effect of riders on the
  overall efficacy of mobility services. We have adapted the MATSim simulator framework
  to incorporate the proposed algorithms present a simulation analysis of a case study
  in Nashville, Tennessee that assesses the effects of our routing models on the traffic
  congestion for different levels of penetration and adoption of socially considerate
  routes. Our results indicate that even at a low penetration (social ratio), we are
  able to achieve an improvement in system-level performance.
