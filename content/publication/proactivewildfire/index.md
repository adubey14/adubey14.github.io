abstract: Industrial electric power grid operation subject to an extreme event requires
  decision making by human operators under stressful conditions. Decision making using
  system data informatics under adverse dynamic events, especially if forecasted,
  should be supplemented by intelligent proactive control. Power transmission system
  operation during wildfires requires resiliency-driven proactive control for load
  shedding, line switching, and resource allocation considering the dynamics of the
  wildfire and failure propagation to minimize the impact on the system. However,
  the possible number of line and load switching in an extensive industrial system
  during an event make the traditional prediction-driven and stochastic approaches
  computationally intractable, leading operators to often use preplanned or greedy
  algorithms. In this article, we model and solve the proactive control problem as
  a Markov decision process (MDP) and introduce an integrated testbed for spatiotemporal
  wildfire propagation and proactive power-system operation. Our approach allows the
  controller to provide setpoints for all generation fleets in the power grid. We
  evaluate our approach utilizing the IEEE test system mapped onto a hypothetical
  terrain. Our results show that the proposed approach can help the operator to reduce
  load outage during an extreme event. It reduces power flow through lines that are
  to be de-energized and adjusts the load demand by increasing power flow through
  other lines.
