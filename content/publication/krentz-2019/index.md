abstract: Smart infrastructure demands resilient data storage, and emerging applications
  execute queries on this data over time. Typically, time-series databases serve these
  queries; however, cloud-based time-series storage can be prohibitively expensive.
  As smart devices proliferate, the amount of computing power and memory available
  in our connected infrastructure provides the opportunity to move resilient time-series
  data storage and analytics to the edge. This paper proposes time-series storage
  in a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), and a novel key-generation technique that provides
  time-indexed reads and writes for key-value pairs. Experimental results show this
  technique meets demands for smart infrastructure situations.
