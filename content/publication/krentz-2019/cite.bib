 abstract = {Smart infrastructure demands resilient data storage, and emerging applications execute queries on this data over time. Typically, time-series databases serve these queries; however, cloud-based time-series storage can be prohibitively expensive. As smart devices proliferate, the amount of computing power and memory available in our connected infrastructure provides the opportunity to move resilient time-series data storage and analytics to the edge. This paper proposes time-series storage in a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), and a novel key-generation technique that provides time-indexed reads and writes for key-value pairs. Experimental results show this technique meets demands for smart infrastructure situations.},
