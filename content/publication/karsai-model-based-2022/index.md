abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems makes the rapid propagation
  of requirement changes into the design and implementation code very problematic.
  The goal of the Intent-Driven Adaptive Software program was to develop technologies
  that assist developers in making changes to requirements and automatically propagating
  those changes to the design and implementation of software systems. The Model-based
  Intent-Driven Adaptive software project developed a vision for a comprehensive technology
  to achieve this goal by developing and implementing two components of that vision
  a program specification and synthesis tool, and a domain-specific language and generators
  for the rapid configuration and adaptation of service-based architectures. These
  two results can serve as a foundation for the future implementation of the vision.
