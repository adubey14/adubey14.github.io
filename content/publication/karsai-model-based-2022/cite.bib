 abstract = {The increasing complexity of software systems makes the rapid propagation of requirement changes into the design and implementation code very problematic. The goal of the Intent-Driven Adaptive Software program was to develop technologies that assist developers in making changes to requirements and automatically propagating those changes to the design and implementation of software systems. The Model-based Intent-Driven Adaptive software project developed a vision for a comprehensive technology to achieve this goal by developing and implementing two components of that vision a program specification and synthesis tool, and a domain-specific language and generators for the rapid configuration and adaptation of service-based architectures. These two results can serve as a foundation for the future implementation of the vision.},
