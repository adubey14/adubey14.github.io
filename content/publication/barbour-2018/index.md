abstract: The high capacity utilization and the pre-dominantly single-track network
  topology of freight railroads in the United States causes large variability and
  unpredictability of train arrival times. Predicting accurate estimated times of
  arrival (ETAs) is an important step for railroads to increase efficiency and automation,
  reduce costs, and enhance customer service. We propose using machine learning algorithms
  trained on historical railroad operational data to generate ETAs in real time. The
  machine learning framework is able to utilize the many data points produced by individual
  trains traversing a network track segment and generate periodic ETA predictions
  with a single model. In this work we compare the predictive performance of linear
  and non-linear support vector regression, random forest regression, and deep neural
  network models, tested on a section of the railroad in Tennessee, USA using over
  two years of historical data. Support vector regression and deep neural network
  models show similar results with maximum ETA error reduction of 26% over a statistical
  baseline predictor. The random forest models show over 60% error reduction compared
  to baseline at some points and average error reduction of 42%.
