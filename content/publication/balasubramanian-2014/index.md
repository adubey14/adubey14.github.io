abstract: Software architecture description languages offer a convenient way of describing
  the high-level structure of a software system. Such descriptions facilitate rapid
  prototyping, code generation and automated analysis. One of the big challenges facing
  the software community is the design of architecture description languages that
  are general enough to describe a wide-range of systems, yet detailed enough to capture
  domain-specific properties and provide a high level of tool automation. This paper
  presents the multi-paradigm challenges we faced and solutions we built when creating
  a domain-specific modeling language for software architectures of distributed real-time
  systems.
