abstract: Formation of microgrids have been proposed as a solution to improve grid
  reliability, and enable smoother integration of renewables into the grid. Microgrids
  are sections of the grid that can operate in isolation from the main power system.
  Maintaining power balance within an islanded microgrid is a challenging task, due
  to the low system inertia, which requires complex control to maintain stable and
  optimized operation. Many studies have demonstrated feasible distributed microgrid
  controllers that can maintain microgrid stability in grid connected and islanded
  modes. However, there is little emphasis on how to implement these distributed algorithms
  on a computational platform that allows for fast and seamless deployment. This paper
  introduces a decentralized software platform called Resilient Information Architecture
  Platform for Smart Systems (RIAPS) that runs on processors embedded with the microgrid
  component. As an example, we describe the implementation of a distributed microgrid
  secondary control and resynchronization algorithms on RIAPS platform. The controller
  developed on RIAPS platform is validated on a real-time microgrid testbed.
