abstract: Improvements in mobile networking combined with the ubiquitous availability
  and adoption of low-cost development boards have enabled the vision of mobile platforms
  of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), such as fractionated spacecraft and UAV swarms.
  Computation and communication resources, sensors, and actuators that are shared
  among different applications characterize these systems. The cyber-physical nature
  of these systems means that physical environments can affect both the resource availability
  and software applications that depend on resource availability. While many application
  development and management challenges associated with such systems have been described
  in existing literature, resilient operation and execution have received less attention.
  This paper describes our work on improving runtime support for resilience in mobile
  CPS, with a special focus on our runtime infrastructure that provides autonomous
  resilience via self-reconfiguration. We also describe the interplay between this
  runtime infrastructure and our design-time tools, as the later is used to statically
  determine the resilience properties of the former. Finally, we present a use case
  study to demonstrate and evaluate our design-time resilience analysis and runtime
  self-reconfiguration infrastructure.
