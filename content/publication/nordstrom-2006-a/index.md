abstract: Reflex and healing architectures have been shown to provide adequate user-defined
  initial failure mitigation behaviors in the presence of system faults. What is lacking,
  however, is a user-guided means of healing the system after the initial reflexes
  have been enacted. This process should be autonomic in the sense that new system
  configurations can be achieved by defining a priori only a small set of criteria
  to which the healed system should conform. What follows is an explanation of this
  technique for guided healing which allows system designers to direct the healing
  process from a higher level in such a way that the resulting system configurations
  satisfy their particular needs. A brief example outlining the application of this
  approach is given
