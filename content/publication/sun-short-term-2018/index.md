abstract: Unpredictability is one of the top reasons that prevent people from using
  public transportation. To improve the on-time performance of transit systems, prior
  work focuses on updating schedule periodically in the long-term and providing arrival
  delay prediction in real-time. But when no real-time transit and traffic feed is
  available (e.g., one day ahead), there is a lack of effective contextual prediction
  mechanism that can give alerts of possible delay to commuters. In this paper, we
  propose a generic tool-chain that takes standard General Transit Feed Specification
  (GTFS) transit feeds and contextual information (recurring delay patterns before
  and after big events in the city and the contextual information such as scheduled
  events and forecasted weather conditions) as inputs and provides service alerts
  as output. Particularly, we utilize shared route segment networks and multi-task
  deep neural networks to solve the data sparsity and generalization issues. Experimental
  evaluation shows that the proposed toolchain is effective at predicting severe delay
  with a relatively high recall of 76% and F1 score of 55%.
