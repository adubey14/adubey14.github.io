abstract: 'While traditional design-time and off-line approaches to testing and verification
  contribute significantly to improving and ensuring high dependability of software,
  they may not cover all possible fault scenarios that a system could encounter at
  runtime. Thus, runtime health management of complex embedded software systems is
  needed to improve their dependability. Our approach to Software Health Management
  uses concepts from the field of Systems Health Management: detection, diagnosis
  and mitigation. In earlier work we had shown how to use a reactive mitigation strategy
  specified using a timed state machine model for system health manager. This paper
  describes the algorithm and key concepts for an alternative approach to system mitigation
  using a deliberative strategy, which relies on a function-allocation model to identify
  alternative component-assembly configurations that can restore the functions needed
  for the goals of the system.'
