abstract: 'Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) can be divided into two major categories:
  offline VRPs, which consider a given set of trip requests to be served, and online
  VRPs, which consider requests as they arrive in real-time. Based on discussions
  with public transit agencies, we identify a real-world problem that is not addressed
  by existing formulations: booking trips with flexible pickup windows (e.g., 3 hours)
  in advance (e.g., the day before) and confirming tight pickup windows (e.g., 30
  minutes) at the time of booking. Such a service model is often required in paratransit
  service settings, where passengers typically book trips for the next day over the
  phone. To address this gap between offline and online problems, we introduce a novel
  formulation, the offline vehicle routing problem with online bookings. This problem
  is very challenging computationally since it faces the complexity of considering
  large sets of requests—similar to offline VRPs—but must abide by strict constraints
  on running time—similar to online VRPs. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
  computational approach, which combines an anytime algorithm with a learning-based
  policy for real-time decisions. Based on a paratransit dataset obtained from our
  partner transit agency, we demonstrate that our novel formulation and computational
  approach lead to significantly better outcomes in this service setting than existing
  algorithms.'
