abstract: In this work, we present a Real-Time, Multi-layer cybEr–power TestbEd for
  the Resiliency analysis (RT-METER) to support power grid operation and planning.
  Developed cyber-power testbed provides a mechanism for end-to-end validation of
  advanced tools for cyber-power grid monitoring, control, and planning. By integrating
  a host of features across three core layers---physical power system, communication
  network, and monitoring/ control center with advanced tools,---the testbed allows
  for the simulation of rich and varied cyber-power grid scenarios and the generating
  realistic sensor, system, and network data. Developing advanced tools to assist
  operators during complex and challenging scenarios is essential for the successful
  operation of the future grid. We detail a suite of algorithmic tools validated using
  the developed testbed for the realistic grid data.
