abstract: As the number of low cost computing devices at the edge of communication
  network increase, there are greater opportunities to enable innovative capabilities,
  especially in cyber-physical systems. For example, micro-grid power systems can
  make use of computing capabilities at the edge of a Smart Grid to provide more robust
  and decentralized control. However, the downside to distributing intelligence to
  the edge away from the controlled environment of the data centers is the increased
  risk of failures. The paper introduces a framework for handling these challenges.
  The contribution of this framework is to support strategies to (a) tolerate the
  transient faults as they appear due to network fluctuations or node failures, and
  to (b) systematically reconfigure the application if the faults persist.
