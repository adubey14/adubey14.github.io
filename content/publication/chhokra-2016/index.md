abstract: The power grid incorporates a number of protection elements such as distance
  relays that detect faults and prevent the propagation of failure effects from influencing
  the rest of system. However, the decision of these protection elements is only influenced
  by local information in the form of bus voltage/current (V-I) samples. Due to lack
  of system wide perspective, erroneous settings, and latent failure modes, protection
  devices often mis-operate and cause cascading effects that ultimately lead to blackouts.
  Blackouts around the world have been triggered or worsened by circuit breakers tripping,
  including the blackout of 2003 in North America, where the secondary/ remote protection
  relays incorrectly opened the breaker. Tools that aid the operators in finding the
  root cause of the problem on-line are required. However, high system complexity
  and the interdependencies between the cyber and physical elements of the system
  and the mis-operation of protection devices make the failure diagnosis a challenging
  problem.
