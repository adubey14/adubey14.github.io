abstract: Syntheto is a surface language for carrying out formally verified program
  synthesis by transformational refinement in ACL2 using the APT toolkit. Syntheto
  aims at providing more familiarity and automation, in order to make this technology
  more widely usable. Syntheto is a strongly statically typed functional language
  that includes both executable and non-executable constructs, including facilities
  to state and prove theorems and facilities to apply proof-generating transformations.
  Syntheto is integrated into an IDE with a notebook-style, interactive interface
  that translates Syntheto to ACL2 definitions and APT transformation invocations,
  and back-translates the prover's results to Syntheto; the bidirectional translation
  happens behind the scenes, with the user interacting solely with Syntheto.
