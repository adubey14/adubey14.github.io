abstract: The rise in deep learning models in recent years has led to various innovative
  solutions for intelligent transportation technologies. Use of personal and on-demand
  mobility services puts a strain on the existing road network in a city. To mitigate
  this problem, city planners need a simulation framework to evaluate the effect of
  any incentive policy in nudging commuters towards alternate modes of travel, such
  as bike and car-share options. In this paper, we leverage MATSim, an agent-based
  simulation framework, to integrate agent preference models that capture the altruistic
  behavior of an agent in addition to their disutility proportional to the travel
  time and cost. These models are learned in a data-driven approach and can be used
  to evaluate the sensitivity of an agent to system-level disutility and monetary
  incentives given, e.g., by the transportation authority. This framework provides
  a standardized environment to evaluate the effectiveness of any particular incentive
  policy of a city, in nudging its residents towards alternate modes of transportation.
  We show the effectiveness of the approach and provide analysis using a case study
  from the Metropolitan Nashville area.
