 abstract = {This work presents a dashboard tool that helps emergency responders analyze and manage spatial-temporal incidents like crime and traffic accidents. It uses state-of-the-art statistical models to learn incident probabilities based on factors such as prior incidents, time and weather. The dashboard can then present historic and predicted incident distributions. It also allows responders to analyze how moving or adding depots (stations for emergency responders) affects average response times, and can make dispatching recommendations based on heuristics. Broadly, it is a one-stop tool that helps responders visualize historical data as well as plan for and respond to incidents.},
