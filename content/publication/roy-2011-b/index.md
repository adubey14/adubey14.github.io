abstract: For service providers of multi-tiered component-based applications, such
  as web portals, assuring high performance and availability to their customers without
  impacting revenue requires effective and careful capacity planning that aims at
  minimizing the number of resources, and utilizing them efficiently while simultaneously
  supporting a large customer base and meeting their service level agreements. This
  paper presents a novel, hybrid capacity planning process that results from a systematic
  blending of 1) analytical modeling, where traditional modeling techniques are enhanced
  to overcome their limitations in providing accurate performance estimates; 2) profile-based
  techniques, which determine performance profiles of individual software components
  for use in resource allocation and balancing resource usage; and 3) allocation heuristics
  that determine minimum number of resources to allocate software components. Our
  results illustrate that using our technique, performance (i.e., bounded response
  time) can be assured while reducing operating costs by using 25% less resources
  and increasing revenues by handling 20% more clients compared to traditional approaches.
