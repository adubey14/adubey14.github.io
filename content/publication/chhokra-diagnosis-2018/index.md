abstract: Fault Protection Assemblies are used in cyber-physical systems for automated
  fault-isolation. These devices alter the mode of the system using locally available
  information in order to stop fault propagation. For example, in electrical networks
  relays and breakers isolate faults in order to arrest failure propagation and protect
  the healthy parts of the system. However, these assemblies themselves can have faults,
  which may inadvertently induce secondary failures. Often these secondary failures
  lead to cascade effects, which then lead to total system collapse. This behavior
  is often seen in electrical transmission systems where failures of relays and breakers
  may cause overloading and the disconnection of parts of an otherwise healthy system.
  In the past, we had developed a consistency based diagnosis approach for physical
  systems based on the temporal failure propagation graph. We now describe an extension
  that uses the concept of timed discrete event observers in combination with the
  timed failure propagation graphs to extend the hypothesis to include the possibility
  of failures in the fault protection units. Using a simulated power system case study,
  we show that the combined approach is able to diagnose faults in both the plant
  and the protection devices.
