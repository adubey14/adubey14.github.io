abstract: Large scientific computing data-centers require a distributed dependability
  subsystem that can provide fault isolation and recovery and is capable of learning
  and predicting failures to improve the reliability of scientific workflows. This
  paper extends our previous work on the autonomic scientific workflow management
  systems by presenting a hierarchical dynamic workflow management system that tracks
  the state of job execution using timed state machines. Workflow monitoring is achieved
  using a reliable distributed monitoring framework, which employs publish-subscribe
  middleware built upon OMG Data Distribution Service standard. Failure recovery is
  achieved by stopping and restarting the failed portions of workflow directed acyclic
  graph.
