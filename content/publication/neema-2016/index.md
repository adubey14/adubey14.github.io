abstract: Rapid evolution of energy generation technology and increased used of distributed
  energy resources (DER) is continually pushing utilities to adapt and evolve business
  models to align with these changes. Today, more consumers are also producing energy
  using green generation technologies and energy pricing is becoming rather competitive
  and transactional, needing utilities to increase flexibility of grid operations
  and incorporate transactive energy systems (TES). However, a huge bottleneck is
  to ensure stable grid operations while gaining efficiency. A comprehensive platform
  is therefore needed for grid-scale multi-aspects integrated evaluations. For instance,
  cyber-attacks in a road traffic controllertextquoterights communication network
  can subtly divert electric vehicles in a particular area, causing surge in the grid
  loads due to increased EV charging and people activity, which can potentially disrupt,
  an otherwise robust, grid. To evaluate such a scenario, multiple special-purpose
  simulators (e.g., SUMO, OMNeT++, GridlabD, etc.) must be run in an integrated manner.
  To support this, we are developing a cloud-deployed web- and model-based simulation
  integration platform that enables integrated evaluations of transactive energy systems
  and is highly extensible and customizable for utility-specific custom simulation
  tools.
