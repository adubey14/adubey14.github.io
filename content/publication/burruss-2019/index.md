abstract: This demo showcases the features of an adaptive middleware framework for
  resource constrained autonomous robots like DeepNNCar (Figure 1). These robots use
  Learning Enabled Components (LECs), trained with deep learning models to perform
  control actions. However, these LECs do not provide any safety guarantees and testing
  them is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we have developed an adaptive
  middleware framework that (1) augments the LEC with safety controllers that can
  use different weighted simplex strategies to improve the systems safety guarantees,
  and (2) includes a resource manager to monitor the resource parameters (temperature,
  CPU Utilization), and offload tasks at runtime. Using DeepNNCar we will demonstrate
  the framework and its capability to adaptively switch between the controllers and
  strategies based on its safety and speed performance.
