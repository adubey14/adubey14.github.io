abstract: "Mobile clouds such as network-connected vehicles and satellite clusters\
  \ are an emerging class of systems that are extensions to traditional real-time\
  \ embedded systems: they provide long-term mission platforms made up of dynamic\
  \ clusters of heterogeneous hardware nodes communicating over ad hoc wireless networks.\
  \ Besides the inherent complexities entailed by a distributed architecture, developing\
  \ software and testing these systems is difficult due to a number of other reasons,\
  \ including the mobile nature of such systems, which can require a model of the\
  \ physical dynamics of the system for accurate simulation and testing. This paper\
  \ describes a rapid development and testing framework for a distributed satellite\
  \ system. Our solutions include a modeling language for configuring and specifying\
  \ an application's interaction with the middleware layer, a physics simulator integrated\
  \ with hardware in the loop to provide the system's physical dynamics and the integration\
  \ of a network traffic tool to dynamically vary the network bandwidth based on the\
  \ physical dynamics."
