abstract: The ultimate challenge in system health management is the theory for and
  application of the technology to systems, for instance to an entire vehicle. The
  main problem the designer faces is complexity; simply the sheer size of the system,
  the number of data points, anomalies, and failure modes can be overwhelming. Furthermore,
  systems are heterogeneous and one has to have a systems engineerâ€™s view to understand
  interactions among systems. Yet, system-level health management is crucial, as faults
  increasingly arise from system-level effects and interactions. While individual
  subsystems tend to have built-in redundancy or local anomaly detection, fault management,
  and prognostics features, the system integrators are 287required to provide the
  same capabilities for the entire vehicle, across different engineering subsystems
  and areas.
