abstract: Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable
  energy and improvements in battery technology. Prompted by the increasing complexity
  of power systems, decentralized solutions are emerging that arrange local communities
  into transactive microgrids. This paper addresses the problem of implementing transactive
  energy mechanisms in a distributed setting, providing both privacy and safety. Specifically,
  we design and implement an automated auction and matching system that ensures safety
  (e.g., satisfaction of line capacity constraints), preserves privacy, and promotes
  local trade and market efficiency for transactive energy systems. This design problem
  is challenging because safety, market efficiency, and privacy are competing objectives.
  We implement our solution as a decentralized trading platform built on blockchain
  technology and smart contracts. To demonstrate the viability of our platform, we
  analyze the results of experiments with dozens of embedded devices and energy production
  and consumption profiles using an actual dataset from the transactive energy domain.
