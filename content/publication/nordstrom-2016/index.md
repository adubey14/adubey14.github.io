abstract: 'Embedded computing is an area in which many of the Self-* properties of
  autonomic systems are desirable. Model based tools for designing embedded systems,
  while proven successful in many applications, are not yet applicable toward building
  autonomic or self-sustaining embedded systems. This paper reports on the progress
  made by our group in developing a model based toolset which specifically targets
  the creation of autonomic embedded systems. '
