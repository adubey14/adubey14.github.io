 abstract = {Embedded computing is an area in which many of the Self-* properties of autonomic systems are desirable. Model based tools for designing embedded systems, while proven successful in many applications, are not yet applicable toward building autonomic or self-sustaining embedded systems. This paper reports on the progress made by our group in developing a model based toolset which specifically targets the creation of autonomic embedded systems. },
