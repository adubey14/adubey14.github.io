abstract: Maintaining voltage and frequency stability in an islanded microgrid is
  challenging, due to the low system inertia. In addition, islanded microgrids have
  limited generation capability, requiring that all DGs contribute proportionally
  to meet the system power consumption. This paper proposes a distributed control
  algorithm for optimal apparent power utilization in islanded microgrids. The developed
  algorithm improves system apparent power utilization by maintaining proportional
  power sharing among DGs. A decentralized platform called Resilient Information Architecture
  Platform for Smart Systems (RIAPS) is introduced that runs on processors embedded
  within the DGs. The proposed algorithm is fully implemented in RIAPS platform and
  validated on a real-time microgrid testbed.
