 abstract = {Architecting software for a cloud computing platform built from mobile embedded devices incurs many challenges that aren't present in traditional cloud computing. Both effectively managing constrained resources and isolating applications without adverse performance effects are needed. A practical design- and runtime solution incorporates modern software development practices and technologies along with novel approaches to address these challenges. The patterns and principles manifested in this system can potentially serve as guidelines for current and future practitioners in this field.},
