abstract: Time of incident reporting is a critical aspect of emergency response. However,
  the conventional approaches to receiving incident reports have time delays. Non-traditional
  sources such as crowdsourced data present an opportunity to detect incidents proactively.
  However, detecting incidents from such data streams is challenging due to inherent
  noise and data uncertainty. Naively maximizing detection accuracy can compromise
  spatial-temporal localization of inferred incidents, hindering response efforts.
  This paper presents a novel human-centered AI tool to address the above challenges.
  We demonstrate how crowdsourced data can aid incident detection while acknowledging
  associated challenges. We use an existing CROME framework to facilitate training
  and selection of best incident detection models, based on parameters suited for
  deployment. The human-centered AI tool provides a visual interface for exploring
  various measures to analyze the models for the practitionerâ€™s needs, which could
  help the practitioners select the best model for their situation. Moreover, in this
  study, we illustrate the tool usage by comparing different models for incident detection.
  The experiments demonstrate that the CNN-based incident detection method can detect
  incidents significantly better than various alternative modeling approaches. In
  summary, this research demonstrates a promising application of human-centered AI
  tools for incident detection to support emergency response agencies.
