abstract: In large scale real-time systems many problems associated with self-management
  are exacerbated by the addition of time deadlines. In these systems any autonomic
  behavior must not only be functionally correct but they must also not violate properties
  of liveness, safety and bounded time responsiveness. In this paper we present and
  analyze a realtime reflex engine for providing fault mitigation capability to large
  scale real time systems. We also present a semantic domain for analyzing and verifying
  the properties of such systems along with the framework of real-time reflex engines
