abstract: The growing complexity of software used in large-scale, safety critical
  cyber-physical systems makes it increasingly difficult to expose and hence correct
  all potential defects. There is a need to augment the existing fault tolerance methodologies
  with new approaches that address latent software defects exposed at runtime. This
  paper describes an approach that borrows and adapts traditional ‘System Health Management’
  techniques to improve software dependability through simple formal specification
  of runtime monitoring, diagnosis, and mitigation strategies. The two-level approach
  to health management at the component and system level is demonstrated on a simulated
  case study of an Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU). An ADIRU was categorized
  as the primary failure source for the in-flight upset caused in the Malaysian Air
  flight 124 over Perth, Australia in 2005.
