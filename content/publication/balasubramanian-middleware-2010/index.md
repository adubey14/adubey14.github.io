abstract: Developing large-scale distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems
  is hard in part due to complex deployment and configuration issues involved in satisfying
  multiple quality for service (QoS) properties, such as real-timeliness and fault
  tolerance. This paper makes three contributions to the study of deployment and configuration
  middleware for DRE systems that satisfy multiple QoS properties. First, it describes
  a novel task allocation algorithm for passively replicated DRE systems to meet their
  real-time and fault-tolerance QoS properties while consuming significantly less
  resources. Second, it presents the design of a strategizable allocation engine that
  enables application developers to evaluate different allocation algorithms. Third,
  it presents the design of a middleware agnostic configuration framework that uses
  allocation decisions to deploy application components/replicas and configure the
  underlying middleware automatically on the chosen nodes. These contributions are
  realized in the DeCoRAM (Deployment and Configuration Reasoning and Analysis via
  Modeling) middleware. Empirical results on a distributed testbed demonstrate DeCoRAM's
  ability to handle multiple failures and provide efficient and predictable real-time
  performance.
