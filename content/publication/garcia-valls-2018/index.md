abstract: If last decade viewed computational services as a utilitythen surely this
  decade has transformed computation into a commodity. Computation is now progressively
  integrated into the physical networks in a seamless way that enables cyber-physical
  systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) meet their latency requirements.
  Similar to the concept of “platform as a service” or “software as a service”, both
  cloudlets and fog computing have found their own use cases. Edge devices (that we
  call end or user devices for disambiguation) play the role of personal computers,
  dedicated to a user and to a set of correlated applications. In this new scenario,
  the boundaries between the network node, the sensor, and the actuator are blurring,
  driven primarily by the computation power of IoT nodes like single board computers
  and the smartphones. The bigger data generated in this type of networks needs clever,
  scalable, and possibly decentralized computing solutions that can scale independently
  as required. Any node can be seen as part of a graph, with the capacity to serve
  as a computing or network router node, or both. Complex applications can possibly
  be distributed over this graph or network of nodes to improve the overall performance
  like the amount of data processed over time. In this paper, we identify this new
  computing paradigm that we call Social Dispersed Computing, analyzing key themes
  in it that includes a new outlook on its relation to agent based applications. We
  architect this new paradigm by providing supportive application examples that include
  next generation electrical energy distribution networks, next generation mobility
  services for transportation, and applications for distributed analysis and identification
  of non-recurring traffic congestion in cities. The paper analyzes the existing computing
  paradigms (e.g., cloud, fog, edge, mobile edge, social, etc.), solving the ambiguity
  of their definitions; and analyzes and discusses the relevant foundational software
  technologies, the remaining challenges, and research opportunities.
