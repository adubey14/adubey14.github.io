abstract: Ever increasing complexity of software used in large-scale, safety critical
  cyber-physical systems makes it increasingly difficult to expose and thence correct
  all potential bugs. There is a need to augment the existing fault tolerance methodologies
  with new approaches that address latent software bugs exposed at runtime. This paper
  describes an approach that borrows and adapts traditional textquoteleftSystems Health
  Managementtextquoteright techniques to improve software dependability through simple
  formal specification of  runtime monitoring, diagnosis  and mitigation strategies.
  The two-level approach of Health Management at Component and System level  is demonstrated
  on a simulated case study of an Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU).  That
  subsystem was categorized as the primary failure source for the in-flight upset
  caused in the Malaysian Air flight 124 over Perth, Australia in August 2005.
