abstract: The emergence of blockchains and smart contracts have renewed interest in
  electrical cyber-physical systems, especially in the area of transactive energy
  systems. However, despite recent advances, there remain significant challenges that
  impede the practical adoption of blockchains in transactive energy systems, which
  include implementing complex market mechanisms in smart contracts, ensuring safety
  of the power system, and protecting residential consumersâ€™ privacy. To address these
  challenges, we present TRANSAX, a blockchain-based transactive energy system that
  provides an efficient, safe, and  privacy-preserving market built on smart contracts.
  Implementation and deployment of TRANSAX in a verifiably correct and efficient way
  is based on VeriSolid, a framework for the correct-by-construction development of
  smart contracts, and RIAPS, a middleware for resilient distributed power systems
