abstract: Electrical power systems are heavily instrumented with protection assemblies
  (relays and breakers) that detect anomalies and arrest failure propagation. However,
  failures in these discrete protection devices could have inadvertent consequences,
  including cascading failures resulting in blackouts. This paper aims to model the
  behavior of these discrete protection devices in nominal and faulty conditions and
  apply it towards simulation and contingency analysis of cascading failures in power
  transmission systems. The behavior under fault conditions are used to identify and
  explain conditions for blackout evolution which are not otherwise obvious. The results
  are demonstrated using a standard IEEE-14 Bus System.
