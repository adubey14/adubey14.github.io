abstract: This paper discusses a mixed method that combines unsupervised learning
  methods and human expert input for analyzing telemetry data from long-duration robotic
  space missions. Our goal is to develop more automated methods  detecting anomalies
  in time series data. Once anomalies are identified using unsupervised learning methods
  we use feature selection methods followed by expert input to derive the knowledge
  required for building on-line detectors. These detectors can be used in later phases
  of the current mission and in future missions for improving operations and overall
  safety of the mission. Whereas the primary focus in this paper is on developing
  data-driven anomaly detection methods, we also present a computational platform
  for data mining and analytics that can operate on historical data offline, as well
  as incoming telemetry data on-line.
