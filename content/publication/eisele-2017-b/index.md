abstract: The emerging Fog Computing paradigm provides an additional computational
  layer that enables new capabilities in real-time data-driven applications. This
  is especially interesting in the domain of Smart Grid as the boundaries between
  traditional generation, distribution, and consumer roles are blurring. This is a
  reflection of the ongoing trend of intelligence distribution in Smart Systems. In
  this paper, we briefly describe a component-based decentralized software platform
  called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Systems (RIAPS) which
  provides an infrastructure for such systems. We briefly describe some initial applications
  built using this platform. Then, we focus on the design and integration choices
  for a resilient Discovery Manager service that is a critical component of this infrastructure.
  The service allows applications to discover each other, work collaboratively, and
  ensure the stability of the Smart System.
