abstract: 'One of the key requirements for designing safety critical cyber physical
  systems (CPS) is to ensure resiliency. Typically, the cyber sub-system in a CPS
  is empowered with protection devices that quickly detect and isolate faulty components
  to avoid failures. However, these protection devices can have internal faults that
  can cause cascading failures, leading to system collapse. Thus, to guarantee the
  resiliency of the system, it is necessary to identifythe root cause(s) of a given
  system disturbance to take appropriate control actions. Correct failure diagnosis
  in such systems depends upon an integrated fault model of the system that captures
  the effect of faults in CPS as well as nominal and faulty operation of protection
  devices, sensors, and actuators. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based qualitative
  fault modeling formalism for CPS, called, Temporal Causal Diagrams(TCDs) that allow
  system designers to effectively represent faultsand their effects in both physical
  and cyber sub-systems. The paper also discusses in detail the fault propagation
  and execution semantics of a TCD model by translating to timed automata and thus
  allowing an efficient means to quickly analyze, validate and verify the fault model.
  In the end, we show the efficacy of the modeling approach with the help of a case
  study from energy system.  '
