abstract: Fog/Edge computing is increasingly used to support a wide range of latency-sensitive
  Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to its elastic computing capabilities
  that are offered closer to the users. Despite this promise, IoT applications with
  user mobility face many challenges since offloading the application functionality
  from the edge to the fog may not always be feasible due to the intermittent connectivity
  to the fog, and could require application migration among fog nodes due to user
  mobility. Likewise, executing the applications exclusively on the edge may not be
  feasible due to resource constraints and battery drain. To address these challenges,
  this paper describes URMILA, a resource management middleware that makes effective
  tradeoffs between using fog and edge resources while ensuring that the latency requirements
  of the IoT applications are met. We evaluate URMILA in the context of a real-world
  use case on an emulated but realistic IoT testbed.
