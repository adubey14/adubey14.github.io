abstract: Transactive microgrids have emerged as a transformative solution for the
  problems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase in the use of
  distributed energy resources and rapid growth in renewable energy generation. Transactive
  microgrids are tightly coupled cyber and physical systems, which require resilient
  and robust financial markets where transactions can be submitted and cleared, while
  ensuring that erroneous or malicious transactions cannot destabilize the grid. In
  this paper, we introduce TRANSAX, a novel decentralized platform for transactive
  microgrids. TRANSAX enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which
  improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, reducing the
  load on the distribution system operator. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants
  by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while
  also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements,
  such as keeping power flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy
  the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy, and we
  demonstrate its performance using simulation results.
