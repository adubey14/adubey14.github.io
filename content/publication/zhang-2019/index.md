abstract: 'Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) helps maintain and distribute predefined
  types of information and data in a decentralized manner. It removes the reliance
  on a third-party intermediary, while securing information exchange and creating
  shared truth via transaction records that are hard to tamper with. The successful
  operation of DLT stems largely from two computer science technologies: consensus
  mechanisms and information security protocols. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof
  of Work (PoW) and Raft, ensure that the DLT network collectively agrees on contents
  stored in the ledger. Information security protocols, such as encryption and hashing,
  protect data integrity and safeguard data against unauthorized access.  The most
  popular incarnation of DLT has been used in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and
  Ethereum, through public blockchains, which requires the application of more robust
  consensus protocols across the entire network. An example is PoW, which has been
  employed by Bitcoin, but which is also highly energy inefficient. Other forms of
  DLT include consortium and private blockchains where networks are configured within
  federated entities or a single organization, in which case less energy intensive
  consensus protocols (such as Raft) would suffice. This chapter surveys existing
  consensus mechanisms and information security technologies used in DLT.'
