abstract: Memory corruption attacks such as code injection, code reuse, and non-control
  data attacks have become widely popular for compromising safety-critical Cyber-Physical
  Systems (CPS). Moving target defense (MTD) techniques such as instruction set randomization
  (ISR), address space randomization (ASR), and data space randomization (DSR) can
  be used to protect systems against such attacks. CPS often use time-triggered architectures
  to guarantee predictable and reliable operation. MTD techniques can cause time delays
  with unpredictable behavior. To protect CPS against memory corruption attacks, MTD
  techniques can be implemented in a mixed time and event-triggered architecture that
  provides capabilities for maintaining safety and availability during an attack.
  This paper presents a mixed time and event-triggered MTD security approach based
  on the ARINC 653 architecture that provides predictable and reliable operation during
  normal operation and rapid detection and reconfiguration upon detection of attacks.
  We leverage a hardware-in-the-loop testbed and an advanced emergency braking system
  (AEBS) case study to show the effectiveness of our approach.
