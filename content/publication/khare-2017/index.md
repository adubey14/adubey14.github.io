abstract: Emerging smart services, such as indoor smart parking or patient monitoring
  and tracking in hospitals, incur a significant technical roadblock stemming primarily
  from a lack of cost-effective and easily deployable localization framework that
  impedes their widespread deployment. To address this concern, in this paper we present
  a low-cost, indoor localization and navigation system, which performs continuous
  and real-time processing of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and IEEE 802.15.4a compliant
  Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensor data to localize and navigate the concerned entity to
  its desired location. Our approach depends upon fusing the two feature sets, using
  the UWB to calibrate the BLE localization mechanism.
