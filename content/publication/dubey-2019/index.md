abstract: This letter presents an overview of design mechanisms to abstract device
  access protocols in the resilient information architecture platform for smart grid,
  a middleware for developing distributed smart grid applications. These mechanisms
  are required to decouple the application functionality from the specifics of the
  device mechanisms built by the device vendors.
