 abstract = {This letter presents an overview of design mechanisms to abstract device access protocols in the resilient information architecture platform for smart grid, a middleware for developing distributed smart grid applications. These mechanisms are required to decouple the application functionality from the specifics of the device mechanisms built by the device vendors.},
