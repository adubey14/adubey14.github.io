abstract: Sensing and measurement devices are keeping pace with the advancement in
  the industrial power distribution system. The ability to provide time-synchronized
  measurements at a fast reporting rate by distribution-level PMUs (D-PMUs) specially
  with increasing distributed energy resources (DERs) offer great opportunities for
  monitoring and control. However, unlike the transmission systems, the distribution
  system waveforms typically have more noise, harmonics and unbalanced phases, posing
  unique challenges to estimate phasors at the distribution-level. Lack of specific
  standards for performance requirements of D-PMUs make this further challenging.
  This work proposes a novel smart synchrophasor device architecture for estimating
  phasors on polluted signals. The proposed sensor architecture is adaptive to varying
  system conditions and can adjust reporting rates based on system demands. The proposed
  approach employs a Sliding Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) and Signal Estimation by
  Minimizing Parameter Residuals (SEMPR) technique to simultaneously estimate the
  harmonic components along with the fundamental phasor. Further, to accommodate the
  signals generated from varying system conditions in the distribution system, an
  approach is proposed to update the measurement model for the PMU estimation using
  adaptive filtering and goodness-of-fit (GoF) measure.
