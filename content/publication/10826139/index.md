abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for edge/IoT-based distributed
  machine learning, where both privacy and bandwidth efficiency are essential. However,
  as time progresses, edge/IoT-based FL faces challenges such as unpredictable concept
  drift, leading to model performance degradation and the need for frequent retraining.
  To address these challenges, we propose a federated learning framework designed
  for heterogeneous IoT devices, capable of handling continuous data distribution
  changes while accounting for limited storage resources. Our framework introduces
  a server-side drift detection method to minimize bandwidth usage and optimize retraining
  times, conserving IoT device resources. We also present an efficient storage management
  strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by selectively managing incoming data
  streams within device constraints. Additionally, we develop an exemplar-based online
  continual learning algorithm that leverages class prototypes in the deep feature
  space to further combat catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on image
  classification tasks using ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets across four model architectures,
  demonstrating significant improvements in adaptation to concept drift and long-term
  performance stability compared to baseline FL approaches.
