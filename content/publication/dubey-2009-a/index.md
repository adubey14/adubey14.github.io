abstract: Probabilistic models are useful for analyzing systems which operate under
  the presence of uncertainty. In this paper, we present a technique for verifying
  safety and liveness properties for probabilistic timed automata. The proposed technique
  is an extension of a technique used to verify stochastic hybrid automata using an
  approximation with Markov Decision Processes. A case study for CSMA/CD protocol
  has been used to show case the methodology used in our technique.
