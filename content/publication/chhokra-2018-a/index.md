abstract: The resiliency and reliability of critical cyber physical systems like electrical
  power grids are of paramount importance. These systems are often equipped with specialized
  protection devices to detect anomalies and  isolate faults in order to arrest failure
  propagation and protect the healthy parts of the system.  However,  due to the limited
  situational awareness and hidden failures the protection devices themselves, through
  their operation (or mis-operation) may cause overloading and the disconnection of
  parts of an otherwise healthy system. This can result in cascading failures that
  lead to a blackout. Diagnosis of failures in such systems is extremely challenging
  because of the need to account  for faults in both the physical systems as well
  as  the protection devices, and the failure-effect propagation across the system.    Our
  approach  for diagnosing such cyber-physical systems is based on the concept of
  Temporal Causal Diagrams (TCD-s) that capture the  timed discrete models of protection
  devices and their interactions with a system failure propagation graph. In this
  paper we present a refinement of the TCD language with a layer of independent local
  observers that aid in diagnosis. We describe a hierarchical two-tier failure diagnosis
  approach and  showcase the results for 4 different scenarios involving both cyber
  and physical faults in a standard Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9 bus
  system.
