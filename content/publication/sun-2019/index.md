abstract: Public transit is a critical component of a smart and connected community.
  As such, citizens expect and require accurate information about real-time arrival/departures
  of transportation assets. As transit agencies enable large-scale integration of
  real-time sensors and support back-end data-driven decision support systems, the
  dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) paradigm becomes a promising approach
  to make the system smarter by providing online model learning and multi-time scale
  analytics as part of the decision support system that is used in the DDDAS feedback
  loop. In this paper, we describe a system in use in Nashville and illustrate the
  analytic methods developed by our team. These methods use both historical as well
  as real-time streaming data for online bus arrival prediction. The historical data
  is used to build classifiers that enable us to create expected performance models
  as well as identify anomalies. These classifiers can be used to provide schedule
  adjustment feedback to the metro transit authority. We also show how these analytics
  services can be packaged into modular, distributed and resilient micro-services
  that can be deployed on both cloud back ends as well as edge computing resources.
