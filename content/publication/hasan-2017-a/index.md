abstract: 'Reliable operation of electrical power systems in the presence of multiple
  critical N - k contingencies is an important challenge for the system operators.
  Identifying all the possible N - k critical contingencies to design effective mitigation
  strategies is computationally infeasible due to the combinatorial explosion of the
  search space. This paper describes two heuristic algorithms based on the iterative
  pruning of the candidate contingency set to effectively and efficiently identify
  all the critical N - k contingencies resulting in system failure. These algorithms
  are applied to the standard IEEE-14 bus system, IEEE-39 bus system, and IEEE-57
  bus system to identify multiple critical N - k contingencies. '
