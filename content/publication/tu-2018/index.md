abstract: To maintain a stable, flexible and economic operation of a microgrid, hierarchical
  control architecture consisting of primary, secondary and tertiary control is proposed.
  However, the differences in dynamics of microgrid, bandwidths of control levels
  and speed of communication channels make it difficult to comprehensively validate
  the performance of the hierarchical control schemes. In this paper we propose a
  hardware-in-the-loop real-time testbed for microgrid hierarchical control. The proposed
  testbed can be used to validate control performance under different microgrid operating
  modes (grid-tied or islanded), different primary control schemes (current or voltage
  mode) and different secondary control approaches (centralized or distributed). The
  integration of industry-grade hardware that runs primary and secondary control into
  the testbed allows for complete emulation of microgrid operation, and facilitates
  the study of the effects of measurement noise, sampling and communication delays.
