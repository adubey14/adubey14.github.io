abstract: New rideshare and shared-mobility services have transformed urban mobility
  in recent years. Therefore, transit agencies are looking for ways to adapt to this
  rapidly changing environment. In this space, ridepooling has the potential to improve
  efficiency and reduce costs by allowing users to share rides in high-capacity vehicles
  and vans. Most transit agencies already operate various ridepooling services including
  microtransit and paratransit. However, the objectives and constraints for implementing
  these services vary greatly between agencies. This brings multiple challenges. First,
  off-the-shelf ridepooling formulations must be adapted for real-world conditions
  and constraints. Second, the lack of modular and reusable software makes it hard
  to implement and evaluate new ridepooling algorithms and approaches in real-world
  settings. Therefore, we propose an on-demand transportation scheduling software
  for microtransit and paratransit services. This software is aimed at transit agencies
  looking to incorporate state-of-the-art rideshare and ridepooling algorithms in
  their everyday operations. We provide management software for dispatchers and mobile
  applications for drivers and users. Lastly, we discuss the challenges in adapting
  state-of-the-art methods to real-world operations.
