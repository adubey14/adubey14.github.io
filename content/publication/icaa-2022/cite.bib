 abstract = {Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems must often operate under uncertainties
like sensor degradation and distribution shifts in the operating
environment, thus increasing operational risk. Dynamic Assurance of these
systems requires augmenting runtime safety components like
out-of-distribution detectors and risk estimators. Designing these safety
components requires labeled data from failure conditions and risky corner
cases that fail the system. However, collecting real-world data of these
high-risk scenes can be expensive and sometimes not possible. To address
this, there are several scenario description languages with sampling
capability for generating synthetic data from simulators to replicate the
scenes that are not possible in the real world. Most often, simple
search-based techniques like random search and grid search are used as
samplers. But we point out three limitations in using these techniques.
First, they are passive samplers, which do not use the feedback of previous
results in the sampling process. Second, the variables to be sampled may
have constraints that need to be applied. Third, they do not balance the
tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, which we hypothesize is
needed for better coverage of the search space. We present a scene
generation workflow with two samplers called Random Neighborhood Search
(RNS) and Guided Bayesian Optimization (GBO). These samplers extend the
conventional random search and Bayesian Optimization search with the
limitation points. We demonstrate our approach using an Autonomous Vehicle
case study in CARLA simulation. To evaluate our samplers, we compared them
against the baselines of random search, grid search, and Halton sequence
search.},
