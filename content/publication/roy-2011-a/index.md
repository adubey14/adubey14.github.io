abstract: Large-scale component-based enterprise applications that leverage Cloud
  resources expect Quality of Service(QoS) guarantees in accordance with service level
  agreements between the customer and service providers. In the context of Cloud computing,
  auto scaling mechanisms hold the promise of assuring QoS properties to the applications
  while simultaneously making efficient use of resources and keeping operational costs
  low for the service providers. Despite the perceived advantages of auto scaling,
  realizing the full potential of auto scaling is hard due to multiple challenges
  stemming from the need to precisely estimate resource usage in the face of significant
  variability in client workload patterns. This paper makes three contributions to
  overcome the general lack of effective techniques for workload forecasting and optimal
  resource allocation. First, it discusses the challenges involved in auto scaling
  in the cloud. Second, it develops a model-predictive algorithm for workload forecasting
  that is used for resource auto scaling. Finally, empirical results are provided
  that demonstrate that resources can be allocated and deal located by our algorithm
  in a way that satisfies both the application QoS while keeping operational costs
  low.
