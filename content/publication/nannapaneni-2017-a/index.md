abstract: 'Evaluation of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as energy consumption
  is essential for decision-making during the design and operation of smart manufacturing
  systems. The measurements of KPIs are strongly affected by several uncertainty sources
  such as input material uncertainty, the inherent variability in the manufacturing
  process, model uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the sensor measurements of operational
  data. A comprehensive understanding of the uncertainty sources and their effect
  on the KPIs is required to make the manufacturing processes more efficient. Towards
  this objective, this paper proposed an automated methodology to generate a hierarchical
  Bayesian network (HBN) for a manufacturing system from semantic system models, physics-based
  models, and available data in an automated manner, which can be used to perform
  uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis. The semantic system model, which is a
  high-level model describing the system along with its parameters, is assumed to
  be available in the generic modeling environment (GME) platform. Apart from semantic
  description, physics-based models, if available, are assumed to be available in
  model libraries. The proposed methodology was divided into two tasks: (1) automated
  hierarchical Bayesian network construction using the semantic system model, available
  models and data, and (2) automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis. A metamodel
  of an HBN was developed using the GME, along with a syntax representation for the
  associated conditional probability tables/distributions. The constructed HBN corresponding
  to a system was represented as an instance model of the HBN metamodel. On the metamodel,
  a model interpreter was written to be able to carry out the UQ analysis in an automated
  manner for any HBN instance model conforming to the HBN metamodel. The proposed
  methodologies are demonstrated using an injection molding process.'
