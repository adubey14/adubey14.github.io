 abstract = {The emerging CPS/IoT ecosystem platforms such as Beaglebone Black, Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison and other edge devices such as SCALE, Paradrop are providing new capabilities for data collection, analysis and processing at the edge (also referred to as Fog Computing). This allows the dynamic composition of computing and communication networks that can be used to monitor and control the physical phenomena closer to the physical system. However, there are still a number of challenges that exist and must be resolved before we see wider applicability of these platforms for applications in safety-critical application domains such as Smart Grid and Traffic Control.},
