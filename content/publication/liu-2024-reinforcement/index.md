abstract: Strategic aggregation of electric vehicle batteries as energy reservoirs
  can optimize power grid demand, benefiting smart and connected communities, especially
  large office buildings that offer workplace charging. This involves optimizing charging
  and discharging to reduce peak energy costs and net peak demand, monitored over
  extended periods (e.g., a month), which involves making sequential decisions under
  uncertainty and delayed and sparse rewards, a continuous action space, and the complexity
  of ensuring generalization across diverse conditions. Existing algorithmic approaches,
  e.g., heuristic-based strategies, fall short in addressing real-time decision-making
  under dynamic conditions, and traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models struggle
  with large stateaction spaces, multi-agent settings, and the need for long-term
  reward optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel RL framework
  that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient approach (DDPG) with action
  masking and efficient MILP-driven policy guidance. Our approach balances the exploration
  of continuous action spaces to meet user charging demands. Using real-world data
  from a major electric vehicle manufacturer, we show that our approach comprehensively
  outperforms many well-established baselines and several scalable heuristic approaches,
  achieving significant cost savings while meeting all charging requirements. Our
  results show that the proposed approach is one of the first scalable and general
  approaches to solving the V2B energy management challenge.
