abstract: Transactive energy systems (TES) are emerging as a transformative solution
  for the problems faced by distribution system operators due to an increase in the
  use of distributed energy resources and a rapid acceleration in renewable energy
  generation. These, on one hand, pose a decentralized power system controls problem,
  requiring strategic microgrid control to maintain stability for the community and
  for the utility. On the other hand, they require robust financial markets operating
  on distributed software platforms that preserve privacy. In this paper, we describe
  the implementation of a novel, blockchain-based transactive energy system. We outline
  the key requirements and motivation of this platform, describe the lessons learned,
  and provide a description of key architectural components of this system.
