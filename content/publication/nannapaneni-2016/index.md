abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems with a tight integration between
  the computational (also referred to as software or cyber) and physical (hardware)
  components. While the reliability evaluation of physical systems is well-understood
  and well-studied, reliability evaluation of CPS is difficult because software systems
  do not degrade and follow a well-defined failure model like physical systems. In
  this paper, we propose a framework for formulating the CPS reliability evaluation
  as a dependence problem derived from the software component dependences, functional
  requirements and physical system dependences. We also consider sensor failures,
  and propose a method for estimating software failures in terms of associated hardware
  and software inputs. This framework is codified in a domain-specific modeling language,
  where every system-level function is mapped to a set of required components using
  functional decomposition and function-component association; this provides details
  about operational constraints and dependences. We also illustrate how the encoded
  information can be used to make reconfiguration decisions at runtime. The proposed
  methodology is demonstrated using a smart parking system, which provides localization
  and guidance for parking within indoor environments.
