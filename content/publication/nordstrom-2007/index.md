abstract: In large scale scientific computing, proper planning and management of computational
  resources lead to higher system utilizations and increased scientific productivity.
  Scientists are increasingly leveraging the use of business process management techniques
  and workflow management tools to balance the needs of the scientific analyses with
  the availability of computational resources. However, the advancements in productivity
  from execution of workflows in a large scale computing environments are often thwarted
  by runtime resource failures. This paper presents our initial work toward autonomic
  model based fault analysis in workflow based environments
