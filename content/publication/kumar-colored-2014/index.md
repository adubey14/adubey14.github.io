abstract: Distributed Real-Time Embedded (DRE) Systems that address safety and mission-critical
  system requirements are applied in a variety of domains today. Complex, integrated
  systems like managed satellite clusters expose heterogeneous concerns such as strict
  timing requirements, complexity in system integration, deployment, and repair; and
  resilience to faults. Integrating appropriate modeling and analysis techniques into
  the design of such systems helps ensure predictable, dependable and safe operation
  upon deployment. This paper describes how we can model and analyze applications
  for these systems in order to verify system properties such as lack of deadline
  violations. Our approach is based on (1) formalizing the component operation scheduling
  using Colored Petri nets (CPN), (2) modeling the abstract temporal behavior of application
  components, and (3) integrating the business logic and the component operation scheduling
  models into a concrete CPN, which is then analyzed. This model-driven approach enables
  a verication-driven workow wherein the application model can be rened and restructured
  before actual code development.
