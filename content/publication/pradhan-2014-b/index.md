abstract: Multi-module Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), such as satellite clusters,
  swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and fleets of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles
  (UUV) are examples of managed distributed real-time systems where mission-critical
  applications, such as sensor fusion or coordinated flight control, are hosted. These
  systems are dynamic and reconfigurable, and provide a \"CPS cluster-as-a-servicetextquoterighttextquoteright
  for mission-specific scientific applications that can benefit from the elasticity
  of the cluster membership and heterogeneity of the cluster members. Distributed
  and remote nature of these systems often necessitates the use of Deployment and
  Configuration (D&C) services to manage lifecycle of software applications. Fluctuating
  resources, volatile cluster membership and changing environmental conditions require
  resilience. However, due to the dynamic nature of the system, human intervention
  is often infeasible. This necessitates a self-adaptive D&C infrastructure that supports
  autonomous resilience. Such an infrastructure must have the ability to adapt existing
  applications on the fly in order to provide application resilience and must itself
  be able to adapt to account for changes in the system as well as tolerate failures.   This
  paper describes the design and architectural considerations to realize a self-adaptive,
  D&C infrastructure for CPSs. Previous efforts in this area have resulted in D&C
  infrastructures that support application adaptation via dynamic re-deployment and
  re-configuration mechanisms. Our work, presented in this paper, improves upon these
  past efforts by implementing a self-adaptive D&C infrastructure which itself is
  resilient. The paper concludes with experimental results that demonstrate the autonomous
  resilience capabilities of our new D&C infrastructure.
