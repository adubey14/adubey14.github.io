abstract: Transportation management platforms provide communities the ability to integrate
  the available mobility options and localized transportation demand management policies.
  A central component of a transportation management platform is the mobility planning
  application. Given the societal relevance of these platforms, it is necessary to
  ensure that they operate resiliently. Modularity and extensibility are also critical
  properties that are required for manageability. Modularity allows to isolate faults
  easily. Extensibility enables update of policies and integration of new mobility
  modes or new routing algorithms. However, state of the art mobility planning applications
  like open trip planner, are monolithic applications, which makes it difficult to
  scale and modify them dynamically. This paper describes a microservices based modular
  multi-modal mobility platform Mobilytics, that integrates mobility providers, commuters,
  and community stakeholders. We describe our requirements, architecture, and discuss
  the resilience challenges, and how our platform functions properly in presence of
  failure. Conceivably, the patterns and principles manifested in our system can serve
  as guidelines for current and future practitioners in this field.
