abstract: This work presents a dashboard tool that helps emergency responders analyze
  and manage spatial-temporal incidents like crime and traffic accidents. It uses
  state-of-the-art statistical models to learn incident probabilities based on factors
  such as prior incidents, time and weather. The dashboard can then present historic
  and predicted incident distributions. It also allows responders to analyze how moving
  or adding depots (stations for emergency responders) affects average response times,
  and can make dispatching recommendations based on heuristics. Broadly, it is a one-stop
  tool that helps responders visualize historical data as well as plan for and respond
  to incidents.
