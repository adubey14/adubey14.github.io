abstract: Modern Power Systems have evolved into a very complex network of multiple
  sources, lines, breakers, loads and others. The performance of these interdependent
  components decide the reliability of the power systems. A tool called “Reasoner”
  is being developed to deduce fault propagations using a Temporal Causal Diagram
  (TCD) approach. It translates the physical system as a Cause-effect model. This
  work discusses the development of an advanced distance relay model, which monitors
  the system, and challenges the operation of reasoner for refinement. Process of
  generation of a Fault and Discrepancy Mapping file from the test system is presented.
  This file is used by the reasoner to scrutinize relays' responses for active system
  faults, and hypothesize potential mis-operations (or cyber faults) with a confidence
  metric. Analyzer (relay model) is integrated to OpenDSS for fault analysis. The
  understanding of the system interdependency (fault propagation behavior) using reasoner
  can make the grid more robust against cascaded failures.
