abstract: The emerging CPS/IoT ecosystem platforms such as Beaglebone Black, Raspberry
  Pi, Intel Edison and other edge devices such as SCALE, Paradrop are providing new
  capabilities for data collection, analysis and processing at the edge (also referred
  to as Fog Computing). This allows the dynamic composition of computing and communication
  networks that can be used to monitor and control the physical phenomena closer to
  the physical system. However, there are still a number of challenges that exist
  and must be resolved before we see wider applicability of these platforms for applications
  in safety-critical application domains such as Smart Grid and Traffic Control.
