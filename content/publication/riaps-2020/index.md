abstract: Microgrids are seen as an effective way to achieve reliable, resilient,
  and efficient operation of the power distribution system. Core functions of the
  microgrid control system are defined by the IEEE Standard 2030.7; however, the algorithms
  that realize these functions are not standardized, and are a topic of research.
  Furthermore, the corresponding controller hardware, operating system, and communication
  system to implement these functions vary significantly from one implementation to
  the next. In this article, we introduce an open-source platform, resilient information
  architecture platform for the smart grid (RIAPS), ideally suited for implementing
  and deploying distributed microgrid control algorithms. RIAPS provides a design-time
  tool suite for development and deployment of distributed microgrid control algorithms.
  With support from a number of run-time platform services, developed algorithms can
  be easily implemented and deployed into real microgrids. To demonstrate the unique
  features of RIAPS, we propose and implement a distributed microgrid secondary control
  algorithm capable of synchronized and proportional compensation of voltage unbalance
  using distributed generators. Test results show the effectiveness of the proposed
  control and the salient features of the RIAPS platform.
