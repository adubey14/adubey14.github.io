abstract: 'Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable
  energy and improvements in battery technology. Prompted by the increasing complexity
  of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, which arrange local
  communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionality of these solutions
  is to provide mechanisms for matching producers with consumers while ensuring system
  safety. However, there are multiple challenges that these solutions still face:
  privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacy challenge arises because the time series
  of production and consumption data for each participant is sensitive and may be
  used to infer personal information. Trust is an issue because a producer or consumer
  can renege on the promised energy transfer. Providing resilience is challenging
  due to the possibility of failures in the infrastructure that is required to support
  these market based solutions. In this paper, we develop a rigorous solution for
  transactive microgrids that addresses all three challenges by providing an innovative
  combination of MILP solvers, smart contracts, and publish-subscribe middleware within
  a framework of a novel distributed application platform, called Resilient Information
  Architecture Platform for Smart Grid. Towards this purpose, we describe the key
  architectural concepts, including fault tolerance, and show the trade-off between
  market efficiency and resource requirements.'
