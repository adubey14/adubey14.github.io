abstract: The push to automate and digitize the electric grid has led to widespread
  installation of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for improved real-time wide-area
  system monitoring and control. Nevertheless, transforming large volumes of highresolution
  PMU measurements into actionable insights remains challenging. A central challenge
  is creating flexible and scalable online anomaly detection in PMU data streams.
  PMU data can hold multiple types of anomalies arising in the physical system or
  the cyber system (measurements and communication networks). Increasing the grid
  situational awareness for noisy measurement data and Bad Data (BD) anomalies has
  become more and more significant. Number of machine learning, data analytics and
  physics based algorithms have been developed for anomaly detection, but need to
  be validated with realistic synchophasor data. Access to field data is very challenging
  due to confidentiality and security reasons. This paper presents a method for generating
  realistic synchrophasor data for the given synthetic network as well as event and
  bad data detection and classification algorithms. The developed algorithms include
  Bayesian and change-point techniques to identify anomalies, a statistical approach
  for event localization and multi-step clustering approach for event classification.
  Developed algorithms have been validated with satisfactory results for multiple
  examples of power system events including faults and load/generator/capacitor variations/switching
  for an IEEE test system. Set of synchrophasor data will be available publicly for
  other researchers.
