abstract: Extensible Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are loosely connected, multi-domain
  platforms that \"virtualize\" their resources to provide an open platform capable
  of hosting different cyber-physical applications. These cyber- physical platforms
  are extensible since resources and applications can be added or removed at any time.
  However, realizing such platform requires resolving challenges emanating from different
  properties; for this paper, we focus on resilience. Resilience is important for
  extensible CPS to make sure that extensibility of a system doesn't result in failures
  and anomalies.
