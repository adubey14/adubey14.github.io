 abstract = {Extensible Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are loosely connected, multi-domain platforms that "virtualize" their resources to provide an open platform capable of hosting different cyber-physical applications. These cyber- physical platforms are extensible since resources and applications can be added or removed at any time. However, realizing such platform requires resolving challenges emanating from different properties; for this paper, we focus on resilience. Resilience is important for extensible CPS to make sure that extensibility of a system doesn't result in failures and anomalies.},
