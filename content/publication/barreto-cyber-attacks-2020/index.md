abstract: Power grids are undergoing major changes due to the rapid adoption of intermittent
  renewable energy resources and the increased availability of energy storage devices.
  These trends drive smart-grid operators to envision a future where peer-to-peer
  energy trading occurs within microgrids, leading to the development of Transactive
  Energy Systems. Blockchains have garnered significant interest from both academia
  and industry for their potential application in decentralized TES, in large part
  due to their high level of resilience. In this paper, we introduce a novel class
  of attacks against blockchain based TES, which target the gateways that connect
  market participants to the system. We introduce a general model of blockchain based
  TES and study multiple threat models and attack strategies. We also demonstrate
  the impact of these attacks using a testbed based on GridLAB-D and a private Ethereum
  network. Finally, we study how to mitigate these attack.
