abstract: 'Fractionated spacecraft is a novel space architecture that uses a cluster
  of small spacecraft modules (with their own attitude control and propulsion systems)
  connected via wireless links to accomplish complex missions. Resources, such as
  sensors, persistent storage space, processing power, and downlink bandwidth can
  be shared among the members of the cluster thanks to the networking. Such spacecraft
  can serve as a cost effective, highly adaptable, and fault tolerant platform for
  running various distributed mission software applications that collect, process,
  and downlink data. Naturally, a key component in such a system is the software platform:
  the distributed operating system and software infrastructure that makes such applications
  possible. Existing operating systems are insufficient, and newer technologies like
  component frameworks do not address all the requirements of such flexible space
  architectures. The high degree of flexibility and the need for thorough planning
  and analysis of the resource management necessitates the use of advanced development
  techniques. This paper describes the core principles and design of a software component
  framework for fractionated spacecraft that is a special case of a distributed real-time
  embedded system. Additionally we describe how a model-driven development environment
  helps with the design and engineering of complex applications for this platform. '
