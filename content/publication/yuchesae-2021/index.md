abstract: 'Electric vehicles (EVs) are critical to the transition to a low-carbon
  transportation system. The successful adoption of EVs heavily depends on energy
  consumption models that can accurately and reliably estimate electricity consumption.
  This paper reviews the state of the art of EV energy consumption models, aiming
  to provide guidance for future development of EV applications. We summarize influential
  variables of EV energy consumption in four categories: vehicle component, vehicle
  dynamics, traffic, and environment-related factors. We classify and discuss EV energy
  consumption models in terms of modeling scale (microscopic vs. macroscopic) and
  methodology (data-driven vs. rule-based). Our review shows trends of increasing
  macroscopic models that can be used to estimate trip-level EV energy consumption
  and increasing data-driven models that utilize machine learning technologies to
  estimate EV energy consumption based on a large volume of real-world data. We identify
  research gaps for EV energy consumption models, including the development of energy
  estimation models for modes other than personal vehicles (e.g., electric buses,
  trucks, and nonroad vehicles), energy estimation models that are suitable for applications
  related to vehicle-to-grid integration, and multiscale energy estimation models
  as a holistic modeling approach.'
