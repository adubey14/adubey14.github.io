abstract: Recent advances in sensor and weapons systems are significantly increasing
  the electrical power that is required and the thermal loads that must be dissipated
  onboard US Navy ships. Thus, design tools and methods must bring detailed consideration
  of all disciplines early in the design process, including electrical, thermal and
  controls in addition to the traditional naval architecture and marine engineering.
  Effective interface of the multiple disciplines demands a collaborative design process.
  The Electric Ship Research and Development Consortium (ESRDC) has developed the
  backbone structure of a collaborative design environment with the goal of bringing
  together many disciplines early in the ship design process. This design environment
  brings many innovations, especially in the arena of simultaneous collaborative design.
  This paper describes the Smart Ship System Design (S3D) environment as developed
  to date, along with overall and discipline-specific visions of implementation of
  the environment in ship design.
