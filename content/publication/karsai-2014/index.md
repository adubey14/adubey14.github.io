abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on distributed computing platforms
  where sensing, computing, actuation, and communication resources are shared by a
  multitude of applications. Such 'cyber-physical cloud computing platforms' present
  novel challenges because the system is built from mobile embedded devices, is inherently
  distributed, and typically suffers from highly fluctuating connectivity among the
  modules. Architecting software for these systems raises many challenges not present
  in traditional cloud computing. Effective management of constrained resources and
  application isolation without adversely affecting performance are necessary. Autonomous
  fault management and real-time performance requirements must be met in a verifiable
  manner. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose
  diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication
  resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security.
  The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting
  of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications.
  The component model facilitates the construction of software applications from modular
  and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact
  only through well-defined mechanisms. The complexity of creating applications and
  performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific
  model-driven development process that relies on a domain-specific modeling language
  and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing
  infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification
  and validation.
