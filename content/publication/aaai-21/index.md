abstract: Affordable public transit services are crucial for communities since they
  enable residents to access employment, education, and other services.  Unfortunately,
  transit services that provide wide coverage tend to suffer from relatively low utilization,
  which results in high fuel usage per passenger per mile, leading to high operating
  costs and environmental impact. Electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy costs
  and environmental impact, but most public transit agencies have to employ them in
  combination with conventional, internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high
  upfront costs of EVs.  To make the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit
  agencies need to optimize route assignments and charging schedules, which presents
  a challenging problem for large transit networks.  We introduce a novel problem
  formulation to minimize fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit
  trips and scheduling them for charging, while serving an existing fixed-route transit
  schedule.  We present an integer program for optimal assignment and scheduling,
  and we propose polynomial-time heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms for larger
  networks. We evaluate our algorithms on the public transit service of Chattanooga,
  TN using operational data collected from transit vehicles.  Our results show that
  the proposed algorithms are scalable and can reduce energy use and, hence, environmental
  impact and operational costs.  For Chattanooga, the proposed algorithms can save
  $145,635 in energy costs and 576.7 metric tons of CO2 emission annually.
