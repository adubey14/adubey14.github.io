abstract: The complexity of software in systems like aerospace vehicles has reached
  the point where new techniques are needed to ensure system dependability. Such techniques
  include a novel direction called textquoteleftSoftware Health Managementtextquoteright
  (SHM) that extends classic software fault tolerance with techniques borrowed from
  System Health Management. In this paper the initial steps towards building a SHM
  approach are described that combine component-based software construction with hard
  real-time operating system platforms. Specifically, the paper discusses how the
  CORBA Component Model could be combined with the ARINC-653 platform services and
  the lessons learned from this experiment. The results point towards both extending
  the CCM as well as revising the ARINC-653
