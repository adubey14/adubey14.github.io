 abstract = {The complexity of software in systems like aerospace vehicles has reached the point where new techniques are needed to ensure system dependability. Such techniques include a novel direction called \textquoteleftSoftware Health Management\textquoteright (SHM) that extends classic software fault tolerance with techniques borrowed from System Health Management. In this paper the initial steps towards building a SHM approach are described that combine component-based software construction with hard real-time operating system platforms. Specifically, the paper discusses how the CORBA Component Model could be combined with the ARINC-653 platform services and the lessons learned from this experiment. The results point towards both extending the CCM as well as revising the ARINC-653},
