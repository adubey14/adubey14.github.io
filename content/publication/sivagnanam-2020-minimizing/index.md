abstract: Public transit can have significantly lower environmental impact than personal
  vehicles; however, it still uses a substantial amount of energy, causing air pollution
  and greenhouse gas emission. While electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy use,
  most public transit agencies have to employ them in combination with conventional,
  internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high upfront costs of EVs. To make
  the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit agencies need to optimize
  route assignments and charging schedules, which presents a challenging problem for
  large public transit networks. We introduce a novel problem formulation to minimize
  fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit trips and scheduling them
  for charging while serving an existing fixed-route transit schedule. We present
  an integer program for optimal discrete-time scheduling, and we propose polynomial-time
  heuristic algorithms and a genetic algorithm for finding solutions for larger networks.
  We evaluate our algorithms on the transit service of a mid-size U.S. city using
  operational data collected from public transit vehicles. Our results show that the
  proposed algorithms are scalable and achieve near-minimum energy use.
