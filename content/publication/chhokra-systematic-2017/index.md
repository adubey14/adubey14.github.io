abstract: Cascading outages in power networks cause blackouts which lead to huge economic
  and social consequences. The traditional form of load shedding is avoidable in many
  cases by identifying optimal load control actions. However, if there is a change
  in the system topology (adding or removing loads, lines etc), the calculations have
  to be performed again. This paper addresses this problem by providing a workflow
  that 1) generates system models from IEEE CDF specifications, 2) identifies a collection
  of blackout causing contingencies, 3) dynamically sets up an optimization problem,
  and 4) generates a table of mitigation strategies in terms of minimal load curtailment.
  We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed methodology by finding load curtailment
  actions for N-k contingencies (k = 1, 2, 3) in IEEE 14 Bus system.
