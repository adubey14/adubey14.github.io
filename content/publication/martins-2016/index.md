abstract: In modern networked control applications, confidentiality and integrity
  are important features to address in order to prevent against attacks. Moreover,
  network control systems are a fundamental part of the communication components of
  current cyber-physical systems (e.g., automotive communications). Many networked
  control systems employ Time-Triggered (TT) architectures that provide mechanisms
  enabling the exchange of precise and synchronous messages. TT systems have computation
  and communication constraints, and with the aim to enable secure communications
  in the network, it is important to evaluate the computational and communication
  overhead of implementing secure communication mechanisms. This paper presents a
  comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the effects of adding a Hash-based Message
  Authentication (HMAC) to TT networked control systems. The contributions of the
  paper include (1) the analysis and experimental validation of the communication
  overhead, as well as a scalability analysis that utilizes the experimental result
  for both wired and wireless platforms and (2) an experimental evaluation of the
  computational overhead of HMAC based on a kernel-level Linux implementation. An
  automotive application is used as an example, and the results show that it is feasible
  to implement a secure communication mechanism without interfering with the existing
  automotive controller execution times. The methods and results of the paper can
  be used for evaluating the performance impact of security mechanisms and, thus,
  for the design of secure wired and wireless TT networked control systems.
