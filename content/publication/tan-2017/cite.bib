 abstract = {We develop a diagrammatic tool for constructing correlations between random variables, called an abstract indicator framework. Abstract indicator frameworks are modeled o operational (key performance) indicator frameworks as they are used in city planning and project governance, and give a rigorous, statistically-motivated process for constructing operational indicator frameworks.},
