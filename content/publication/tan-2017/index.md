abstract: We develop a diagrammatic tool for constructing correlations between random
  variables, called an abstract indicator framework. Abstract indicator frameworks
  are modeled o operational (key performance) indicator frameworks as they are used
  in city planning and project governance, and give a rigorous, statistically-motivated
  process for constructing operational indicator frameworks.
