abstract: The adoption of blockchain based distributed ledgers is growing fast due
  to their ability to provide reliability, integrity, and auditability without trusted
  entities. One of the key capabilities of these emerging platforms is the ability
  to create self-enforcing smart contracts. However, the development of smart contracts
  has proven to be error-prone in practice, and as a result, contracts deployed on
  public platforms are often riddled with security vulnerabilities. This issue is
  exacerbated by the design of these platforms, which forbids updating contract code
  and rolling back malicious transactions. In light of this, it is crucial to ensure
  that a smart contract is secure before deploying it and trusting it with significant
  amounts of cryptocurrency. To this end, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for
  the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a transition-system
  based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows
  developers to reason about and verify contract behavior at a high level of abstraction.
  VeriSolid allows the generation of Solidity code from the verified models, which
  enables the correct-by-design development of smart contracts.
