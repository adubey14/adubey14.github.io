abstract: As the number of personal computing and IoT devices grows rapidly, so does
  the amount of computational power that is available at the edge. Since many of these
  devices are often idle, there is a vast amount of computational power that is currently
  untapped, and which could be used for outsourcing computation. Existing solutions
  for harnessing this power, such as volunteer computing (e.g., BOINC), are centralized
  platforms in which a single organization or company can control participation and
  pricing. By contrast, an open market of computational resources, where resource
  owners and resource users trade directly with each other, could lead to greater
  participation and more competitive pricing. To provide an open market, we introduce
  MODiCuM, a decentralized system for outsourcing computation. MODiCuM deters participants
  from misbehaving-which is a key problem in decentralized systems-by resolving disputes
  via dedicated mediators and by imposing enforceable fines. However, unlike other
  decentralized outsourcing solutions, MODiCuM minimizes computational overhead since
  it does not require global trust in mediation results. We provide analytical results
  proving that MODiCuM can deter misbehavior, and we evaluate the overhead of MODiCuM
  using experimental results based on an implementation of our platform.
