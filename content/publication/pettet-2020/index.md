abstract: 'Emergency Response Management (ERM) is a critical problem faced by communities
  across the globe. Despite its importance, it is common for ERM systems to follow
  myopic and straight-forward decision policies in the real world. Principled approaches
  to aid decision-making under uncertainty have been explored in this context but
  have failed to be accepted into real systems. We identify a key issue impeding their
  adoption --- algorithmic approaches to emergency response focus on reactive, post-incident
  dispatching actions, i.e. optimally dispatching a responder after incidents occur.
  However, the critical nature of emergency response dictates that when an incident
  occurs, first responders always dispatch the closest available responder to the
  incident. We argue that the crucial period of planning for ERM systems is not post-incident,
  but between incidents. However, this is not a trivial planning problem -  a major
  challenge with dynamically balancing the spatial distribution of responders is the
  complexity of the problem. An orthogonal problem in ERM systems is to plan under
  limited communication, which is particularly important in disaster scenarios that
  affect communication networks. We address both the problems by proposing two partially
  decentralized multi-agent planning algorithms that utilize heuristics and the structure
  of the dispatch problem.  We evaluate our proposed approach using real-world data,
  and find that in several contexts, dynamic re-balancing the spatial distribution
  of emergency responders reduces both the average response time as well as its variance. '
