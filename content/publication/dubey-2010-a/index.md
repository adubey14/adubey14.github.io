abstract: The complexity of software in systems like aerospace vehicles has reached
  the point where new techniques are needed to ensure system dependability while improving
  the productivity of developers. One possible approach is to use precisely defined
  software execution platforms that (1) enable the system to be composed from separate
  components, (2) restrict component interactions and prevent fault propagation, and
  (3) whose compositional properties are well-known. In this paper we describe the
  initial steps towards building a platform that combines component-based software
  construction with hard real-time operating system services. Specifically, the paper
  discusses how the CORBA Component Model (CCM) could be combined with the ARINC-653
  platform services and the lessons learned from this experiment. The results point
  towards both extending the CCM as well as revising the ARINC-653.
