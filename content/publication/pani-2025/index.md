abstract: ' Aerial ropeway transit (ART) systems are emerging alternatives to augment
  existing transit systems in congested cities in the Global South, especially in
  urban areas with limited transit coverage because of road width constraints or topography.
  Integration of aerial cable car stations to an existing transit network can improve
  the overall accessibility of various population segments with significant positive
  benefits in relation to reducing transport-related social exclusion. This study
  evaluated the impact of introducing ART in the city of Varanasi (India) and assessed
  the spatial accessibility improvements to critical facility locations such as heritage
  sites, educational institutions, hospitals, and employment centers. Several multimodal
  transit expansion scenarios were considered in this study and the potential benefits
  of each case were quantified using the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA)
  method. A multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was subsequently employed
  for identifying the optimal locations of ART stops. Microlevel analysis findings
  suggest that the mean accessibility values could increase up to 10.92% in the first
  phase of the ART implementation, which could subsequently increase to 24.7% and
  49.8% for the subsequent transit expansion scenarios. The study also investigated
  the Varanasi ART DPR prepared by Varanasi Development Authority (VDA) and showed
  that a significant increase of 16% in accessibility levels could be achieved if
  optimal stop locations identified in this study were implemented. The proposed two-step
  (2SFCA+MCDM) method for identifying the optimal locations of ART stations in a multimodal
  transit network is expected to be an effective tool for transit system redesign
  using place-based accessibility measures. '
