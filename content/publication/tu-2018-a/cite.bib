 abstract = {To integrate DC distributed generation (DG) with micro-source into the existing AC grid, a DC distribution bus can be used to couple on-site photovoltaics (PV), battery energy storage systems (BESS), and DC loads. If the converters connected to the DC bus are interleaved, the DC bus capacitor size could be minimized. In this paper, we propose an interleaving algorithm for multi-converter systems to minimize the current harmonics at switching frequency on the DC bus. The proposed algorithm is implemented using Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid (RIAPS) platform. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation results based on Opal- RT are presented to validate its performance. The influence of synchronization frequency on the proposed algorithm are also considered.},
