abstract: This paper describes a formal framework for reliability assessment of component-based
  systems with respect to specific missions. A mission comprises of different timed
  mission stages, with each stage requiring a number of highlevel functions. The work
  presented here describes a modeling language to capture the functional decomposition
  and missions of a system. The components and their alternatives are mapped to basic
  functions which are used to implement the system-level functions. Our contribution
  is the extraction of mission-specific reliability block diagram from these high-level
  models of component assemblies. This is then used to compute the mission reliability
  using reliability information of components. This framework can be used for real-time
  monitoring of system performance where reliability of the mission is computed over
  time as the mission is in progress. Other quantities of interest such as mission
  feasibility, function availability can also be computed using this framework. Mission
  feasibility answers the question whether the mission can be accomplished given the
  current state of components in the system and function availability provides information
  if the function is available in the future given the current state of the system.
  The software used in this framework includes Generic Modeling Environment (GME)
  and Python. GME is used for modeling the system and Python for reliability computations.
  The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a radio-controlled (RC) car in carrying
  out a simple surveillance mission.
