abstract: This paper proposes a novel modeling and simulation environment for ship
  design based on the principles of Model Integrated Computing (MIC). The proposed
  approach facilitates the design and analysis of shipboard power systems and similar
  systems that integrate components from different fields of expertise. The conventional
  simulation platforms such as Matlab速, Simulink速, PSCAD速 and VTB速 require the designers
  to have explicit knowledge of the syntactic and semantic information of the desired
  domain within the tools. This constraint, however, severely slows down the design
  and analysis process, and causes cross-domain or cross-platform operations remain
  error prone and expensive. Our approach focuses on the development of a modeling
  environment that provides generic support for a variety of application across different
  domains by capturing modeling concepts, composition principles and operation constraints.
  For the preliminary demonstration of the modeling concept, in this paper we limit
  the scope of design to cross-platform implementations of the proposed environment
  by developing an application model of a simplified shipboard power system and using
  Matlab engine and VTB solver separately to evaluate the performance with different
  respects. In the case studies a fault scenario is pre-specified and tested on the
  system model. The corresponding time domain bus voltage magnitude and angle profiles
  are generated via invoking external solver, displayed to users and then saved for
  future analysis.
