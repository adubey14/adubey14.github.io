abstract: Distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems executing mixed criticality
  task sets are increasingly being deployed in mobile and embedded cloud computing
  platforms, including space applications. These DRE systems must not only operate
  over a range of temporal and spatial scales, but also require stringent assurances
  for secure interactions between the system's tasks without violating their individual
  timing constraints. To address these challenges, this paper describes a novel distributed
  operating system focusing on the scheduler design to support the mixed criticality
  task sets. Empirical results from experiments involving a case study of a cluster
  of satellites emulated in a laboratory testbed validate our claims.
