abstract: With the advent of blockchain-enabled IoT applications, there is an increased
  need for related software patterns, middleware concepts, and testing practices to
  ensure adequate quality and productivity. IoT and blockchain each provide different
  design goals, concepts, and practices that must be integrated, including the distributed
  actor model and fault tolerance from IoT and transactive information integrity over
  untrustworthy sources from blockchain. Both IoT and blockchain are emerging technologies
  and both lack codified patterns and practices for development of applications when
  combined. This paper describes PlaTIBART, which is a platform for transactive IoT
  blockchain applications with repeatable testing that combines the Actor pattern
  (which is a commonly used model of computation in IoT) together with a custom Domain
  Specific Language (DSL) and test network management tools. We show how PlaTIBART
  has been applied to develop, test, and analyze fault-tolerant IoT blockchain applications.
