abstract: Location-based services and fleet management are important components of
  modern smart cities. However, statistical analysis with large-scale spatiotemporal
  data in real-time is computationally challenging and can necessitate compromise
  in accuracy or problem simplification. The main contribution of this work is the
  presentation of a stream processing approach for real-time monitoring of resource
  equity in spatially-aware micromobility fleets. The approach makes localized updates
  to resource availability as needed, instead of batch computation of availability
  at regular update intervals. We find that the stream processing approach can compute,
  on average, 62 resource availability updates in the same execution time as a single
  batch computation. This advantage in processing time makes continuous real-time
  stream processing equivalent to a batch computation performed every 15 minutes,
  in terms of algorithm execution time. Since the stream processing approach considers
  every update to the fleet in real-time, resource availability is always up-to-date
  and there is no compromise in terms of accuracy.
