abstract: 'Size and complexity of software in safety critical system is increasing
  at a rapid pace. One technology that can be used to mitigate this complexity is
  component-based software development. However, in spite of the apparent benefits
  of a component-based approach to development, little work has been done in applying
  these concepts to hard real time systems. This paper improves the state of the art
  by making three contributions: (1) we present a component model for hard real time
  systems and define the semantics of different types of component interactions; (2)
  we present an implementation of a middleware that supports this component model.
  This middleware combines an open source CORBA Component Model (CCM) implementation
  (MICO) with ARINC-653: a state of the art RTOS standard, (3) finally; we describe
  a modeling environment that enables design, analysis, and deployment of component
  assemblies. We conclude with a discussion of lessons learned during this exercise.
  Our experiences point towards extending both the CCM as well as revising the ARINC-653.'
