abstract: Architecting software for a cloud computing platform built from mobile embedded
  devices incurs many challenges that aren't present in traditional cloud computing.
  Both effectively managing constrained resources and isolating applications without
  adverse performance effects are needed. A practical design- and runtime solution
  incorporates modern software development practices and technologies along with novel
  approaches to address these challenges. The patterns and principles manifested in
  this system can potentially serve as guidelines for current and future practitioners
  in this field.
