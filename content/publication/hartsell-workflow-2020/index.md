abstract: Development of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) requires close interaction
  between developers with expertise in many domains to achieve ever-increasing demands
  for improved performance, reduced cost, and more system autonomy. Each engineering
  discipline commonly relies on domain-specific modeling languages, and analysis and
  execution of these models is often automated with appropriate tooling. However,
  integration between these heterogeneous models and tools is often lacking, and most
  of the burden for inter-operation of these tools is placed on system developers.
  To address this problem, we introduce a workflow modeling language for the automation
  of complex CPS development processes and implement a platform for execution of these
  models in the Assurance-based Learning-enabled CPS (ALC) Toolchain. Several illustrative
  examples are provided which show how these workflow models are able to automate
  many time-consuming integration tasks previously performed manually by system developers.
