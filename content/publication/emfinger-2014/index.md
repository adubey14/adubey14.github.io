abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly utilizing advances in wireless
  mesh networking among computing nodes to facilitate communication and control for
  distributed applications. Factors such as interference or node mobility cause such
  wireless networks to experience changes in both topology and link capacities. These
  dynamic networks pose a reliability concern for high-criticality or mixed-criticality
  systems which require strict guarantees about system performance and robustness
  prior to deployment. To address the design- and run-time verification and reliability
  concerns created by these dynamic networks, we are developing an integrated modeling,
  analysis, and run-time toolsuite which provides (1) network profiles that model
  the dynamics of system network resources and application network requirements over
  time, (2) design-time verification of application performance on dynamic networks,
  and (3) management of the CPS network resources during run-time. In this paper we
  present the foundations for the analysis of dynamic networks and show experimental
  validations of this analysis. We conclude with a focus on future work and applications
  to the field
