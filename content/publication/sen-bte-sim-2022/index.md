abstract: The public commute is essential to all urban centers and is an efficient
  and environment-friendly way to travel. Transit systems must become more accessible
  and user-friendly. Since public transit is majorly designed statically, with very
  few improvements coming over time, it can get stagnated, unable to update itself
  with changing population trends. To better understand transportation demands and
  make them more usable, efficient, and demographic-focused, we propose a fast, multi-layered
  transit simulation that primarily focuses on public transit simulation (BTE-Sim).
  BTE-Sim is designed based on the population demand, existing traffic conditions,
  and the road networks that exist in a region. The system is versatile, with the
  ability to run different configurations of the existing transit routes, or inculcate
  any new changes that may seem necessary, or even in extreme cases, new transit network
  design as well. In all situations, it can compare multiple transit networks and
  provide evaluation metrics for them. It provides detailed data on each transit vehicle,
  the trips it performs, its on-time performance and other necessary factors. Its
  highlighting feature is the considerably low computation time it requires to perform
  all these tasks and provide consistently reliable results.
