# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Dr. Abhishek Dubey is an Associate Professor of Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Software-Integrated Systems. Abhishek directs the SCOPElab  (https://scopelab.org/) at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems and is the co-lead of the Vanderbilt Initiative for Smart Cities Operation and Research (VISOR). His broad research interest is in the design and operation of decision procedures for smart and connected communities with a focus on transportation and energy networks. In particular, he focuses on the design and operation of Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) based components (AI-CPS) with a focus on public transit systems, emergency response systems, and power grids. For these systems, his lab investigates the principled design, operation, and optimization methods that not only consider the system operations but also consider resilience, performance, and assurance. Key research results include the design of hierarchical decision procedures for responding to motor vehicle crashes, the design of efficient public transit operations and the design of transactive energy systems. Abhishek received the NSF Career award in 2022. His work has been funded by NSF, NASA, DOE, and ARPA-E. AFRL, DARPA, Nissan, Siemens, Cisco, and IBM (Total grant support as PI is 9.3 million.  Grant support as Co-PI is 27 million.). Abhishek completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University in 2009. He received his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University in August 2005 and completed his undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, India, in May 2001.

Dr. Abhishek Dubey is an Associate Professor of Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, Senior Research Scientist at the [Institute for Software-Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu). Abhishek directs the [SCOPElab](https://scopelab.ai/) at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems and is the co-lead of the [Vanderbilt Initiative for Smart Cities Operation and Research (VISOR)](https://alo.ees.vanderbilt.edu/visor/). His broad research interest is in the design and operation of decision procedures for societal-scale Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) with a focus on [public transit systems](https://smarttransit.ai), [emergency response systems](https://statresp.ai), and power grids. For these systems, his lab investigates the principled non-myopic optimization methods that not only consider the system operations but also consider resilience, performance, and assurance. He currently leads smart and connected community research efforts focusing on design and optimization of public transit systems in Chattanooga, TN and Nashville, TN through his group [smarttransit.ai](https://smarttransit.ai)
and the emergency response system optimization through his group [statresp.ai](https://statresp.ai).

He has published more than 150 research articles and has an h-index of 31. Key research results include the design of hierarchical decision procedures for responding to motor vehicle crashes, the design of efficient public transit operations and the design of transactive energy systems. His other contributions include middleware for online fault-detection and recovery in software-intensive distributed systems and a robust software model for building cyber-physical applications, along with spatial and temporal separation among different system components, which guarantees fault isolation. Abhishek received the [NSF Career award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2238815&HistoricalAwards=false) in 2023. His work has been funded by NSF, NASA, DOE, and ARPA-E. AFRL, DARPA, Nissan, Siemens, Cisco, and IBM. Abhishek completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University in 2009.
