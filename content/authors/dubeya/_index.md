# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Dr. Abhishek Dubey is an Associate Professor of Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Software-Integrated Systems. Abhishek directs the SCOPElab  (https://scopelab.org/) at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems and is the co-lead of the Vanderbilt Initiative for Smart Cities Operation and Research (VISOR). His broad research interest is in the design and operation of decision procedures for smart and connected communities with a focus on transportation and energy networks. In particular, he focuses on the design and operation of Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) based components (AI-CPS) with a focus on public transit systems, emergency response systems, and power grids. For these systems, his lab investigates the principled design, operation, and optimization methods that not only consider the system operations but also consider resilience, performance, and assurance. Key research results include the design of hierarchical decision procedures for responding to motor vehicle crashes, the design of efficient public transit operations and the design of transactive energy systems. Abhishek received the NSF Career award in 2022. His work has been funded by NSF, NASA, DOE, and ARPA-E. AFRL, DARPA, Nissan, Siemens, Cisco, and IBM (Total grant support as PI is 9.3 million.  Grant support as Co-PI is 27 million.). Abhishek completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University in 2009. He received his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University in August 2005 and completed his undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, India, in May 2001.
